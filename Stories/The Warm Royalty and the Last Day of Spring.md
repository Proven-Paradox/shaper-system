# The Tale of the Warm Royalty

This was an old story when I was your age, but the telling changes a little each time it is told. And that's fine; it's a story, not a history, and stories are supposed to grow with their tellers. So when you're as old as me, telling the story to your own fire circle, tell the version you think is best. If you prefer two princes, or two princesses, or perhaps to you the demon is a thing that is not quite a man, you should tell it your way. In my version, the story starts with a King, a Queen, a Prince, and a Princess.

First, the Compassionate King. The oldest stories name him Karuna. At the core of him was a wish, above all, that all live free from harm and strife. Because he was assured to be benevolent, he was allowed to have whatever he desired; it would always be for the good of all.

Second, the Equanimous Queen. Her old name is Upekkha. She was known far and wide as the most even-handed and wisest judge. Because she was certain to be just, she was given the task of deciding what to do when there was a disagreement.

Next, the Empathetic Prince. His old name is Mudita. He always knew what you wanted, what you intended to say, and could hear any lie for what it was--just like me, on the last part at least. He served as advisor to his mother, clarifying any misrepresentation and exposing all frauds for what they were.  
((For those keeping up/familiar with the term, I'm aware I'm stretching the definition a little here.))

Finally--though not least by any means--was the Benevolent Princess. Once she was called Metta, or Maitri, depending on who you ask. She wanted to spread joy to everyone she could. She served as advisor to her father, coming up with new ways to improve life in our world.

They ran the realm justly and wisely, together, and for a very long time things were happy. Then a stranger entered their court. I first heard this one called The Eldest Evil. An older telling calls him Mara.

The most well-behaved of you have never heard this before. But some of you are confused now. You might be thinking, 'Old Masac, the first time you told me this story he was called Vicious Victor.' Another might be thinking, 'You told me it was a woman, The First Thief!' All of you who heard it before heard a version where they looked and behaved a bit like you did at the time, didn't you? I think you're old enough to know that those were convenient fabrications. Little fables, meant to make you see some facet of your misbehavior from the most terrible creature our stories give to us. Forgive me for making up a parable, and if you ever believed it forgive yourself for being an impressionable child once upon a time. While I'm at it, Moon Moth Candy isn't actually based on what your spirit is like; we just gave sweet candies to the good kids and bitters to the naughty ones. You're old enough to know these things now.

You may say to that, 'Why then, Old Masac, would you ask me to believe you now?' To that I say, you have a point, but unlike previous versions of the tale this actually is the first way I heard it, more or less. I promise. The question was should you believe me, and I cannot say for certain. I do think something like this did happen long ago, though I am not sure if I've the right names, and perhaps some telling detail was once glossed over and is now forgotten. Indulge me for now and pretend this is true, just to appease an old man. You don't have keep believing me once this story circle is over. 

We call the day The Eldest Evil entered the good court The Last Day of Spring.

The first victim was the vigilant Prince. He looked into the Eldest Evil's eyes, and saw his vile intentions. The Prince was driven to violent illness at contacting a mind so foul, and fled from the court, led by his confused servants. The remaining three royal hosts greeted this newcomer, unsure how to respond. The Queen desired the court adjourned until the Prince had recovered, but both the King and the Princess said that the newcomer should at least be heard first. The Queen could not find a reason not to at least let the stranger speak. Do remember that this creature was only named after these events had unfolded.

The Eldest Evil said nothing for a long time as he examined the gathered court. The rulers were ageless themselves, but counted 1000 mortals among their servants, artists, and scholars--mortals that the Queen made certain were given their due pay, and that the Prince made sure were of good character, as well as their families. There was not a single soul among them you could call a bad person--this one might be prone to mischief while drinking, this one might be shackled by melancholy, but all agree the company the Queen and Prince kept would prompt no reasonable complaints.

After a time, the Compassionate King asked the Eldest Evil, 'Good sir, you linger upon my court wordless for so long. Pray tell, is there a flaw among the souls I have gathered here you find offensive?'

The Eldest Evil laughed, a bright and cheerful sound. 'No, good King! In fact, I greatly envy your fine selection of mortals; a magnificent realm you must rule, to produce such souls!' The King smiled, but before he could speak, the Eldest Evil held up a hand and said, 'Except... for this one.' He pointed to an infant child who stood among the mortals.

Now, this is still the Compassionate King and the Equanimous Queen we speak of! What followed was no barbarity, regardless of the many who would claim the child was executed or tortured or somehow impure. The King and Queen knew full well the child was an innocent soul, but the child was also very young--it may well they were in need of a change, as the stories often claim. The rulers instructed this child's father to take him to a nearby village for a time while they awaited to hear of the stranger's complaint or request.

We do not know much of the child or their father, but they are only reason we know this much of the story. That child was the first to tell this story, as their father died in the ensuing chaos. They would be known as The First Witch.

We do not know what happened next in that room. We only know what happened after.

The 998 mortals still within the palace all perished, their death masks showing primal terror. The Eldest Evil burst from the palace's highest spire, riding away on a Ship on Fire that sailed through the skies, leaving the palace in ruins and leaving in its wake a trail of fire and ash. In his clutches was the Benevolent Princess, imprisoned in a frozen cage.

The Equanimous Queen rushed behind them, paying no heed to the fire as she rushed to her daughter's aid. She was too late, as the ship passed through the deepest point of the earth, through the portal to dreams, and sailed onward out into Nowhere.

The Prince was found later, wailing and mad, lashing out at all who came close to him, The First Dagger in his hand. Some say it was a jagged piece of rock, some a shard of wrapped glass, still others a finely crafted thing of beauty. No one could reason with him afterward; touching the Eldest Evil's mind left him paranoid and unable to tell friend from foe, lashing out at all who approached him.

The Queen never spoke or moved from the spot where she last saw her daughter, the deepest place open to the sky. We cannot know whether she wept only for grief over her children, or if perhaps she judged herself somehow in need of punishment. But she stayed in that deep place and wept an ocean, where she then drowned.

The King was found pinned to his throne by a spear made of ice, a day later, by The First Witch's father. The King said to him that he had made a pact with a power mortals cannot comprehend--as long as there is still hope for either of his children, he would pay any price, sacrifice all his comforts and joy for their sake. He told the child's father to record his recollection of events in a journal, and then take the child to a safe place with it. The final mercy granted to the one we now call The King from whom Nothing More can be Taken, is that only 999 mortals would pay the ultimate price for his folly. The man who took down his tale was granted a year to provide for his child, and then died a merciful death. From that day forward, any comfort the King ever received would be met by misfortune and tragedy in turn.

The Princess, most would say, was consumed upon arriving Nowhere. From the edges of the world, our foes in woe the Preta began creeping from the edges of a new, unending storm. When the Ship on Fire sailed out of our realm, and its fires finally died, the first result was a snow of ash. After followed a type of snow you are much more familiar with.

Today, the King still sits on his miserable throne, somewhere no mortal with sense would visit. While none here would envy his state, know that his pact would end the moment hope for the Prince, or perhaps even the Princess, faded.

Now, you may believe this story a useless yarn from a fool who has lived too long. And you may be right. And if you think this was an accurate accounting of history, I advise you to recall how I opened this story. But for what it's worth, I think it is a story worth examining. Our order's primary role is to defend the world from the preta, who are as unhappy to be thrust into this realm as we are to battle them. But we still seek whatever that glimmer of hope that keeps the Sad Old King on his throne as well.

Now, it has been a long time. Chances are, if this were a thing that mortal hands could change, it would already be done. Do not think yourself under a special order to be the one to save the world, or the Prince, or the Princess. No mortal should ever be asked to shoulder so great a weight, much less when you've so much yet to experience.

But also, humor an old man--do keep an eye out, will you? Just in case.
