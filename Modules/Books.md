# Books

### Blue Books

#### Symphony of Silence  
Blue 3  
On the surface, this appears to be a deep dive treatment of the uses of silence in music theory and composition. It discusses the proper places to put pauses in one's compositions and even has a chapter on precisely how long these pauses should be, broken down by time signature. To those who are attuned to silence already, there are occult meanings to tease out of every third chapter.  
Requirements: Blue 2, Composure or Lore 5 or higher, Stealth 7 or higher 

#### On Endings  
Blue 2  
A death-positive pamphlet written by a mortician about different funeral traditions. It favors a style that is quiet and somber, respectful of the mourners. (Though it also refers to a few other works that cover funeral traditions that are more celebratory as well.)  
Requirements: Blue 1, Composure, Lore, or Stealth 6 or higher  

### Copper Books  

#### The Key to Keeping Secrets  
Copper 2  
A pamphlet that attempts to give practical advice to those who act as confidants or are otherwise compelled into secrecy who feel an urge to spread those secrets. It includes a short paragraph about times where secrecy is not appropriate (mostly relating to the safety or well being of those involved). Afterwards are coping mechanisms and strategies that are supposed to help the reader keep quiet.  
Requirements: Copper 1, Endure, Sabotage, or Streetwise 6 or higher 

### Crimson Books

#### The Duelist's Parable  
Crimson 2  
A collection of short stories about a legendary gladiator named Osserad, who is said to have proposed to his wife seconds after finishing the match that crowned him the champion of his time. Each story ends in a duel, and describes in detail how Osserad handled each fight.  
Requirements: Crimson 1, Athletics, Endure, or Intimidate 6 or higher  

### Orange Books  

#### The Clockwork Prince  
Orange 2  
A novel about a tinkerer who is wrapped up in a scheme to resolve a succession crisis by building a convincing mechanical simulacrum of a deceased prince. It starts with the titular automaton only needing to be seen at parades and the like. The book includes long diatribes that are really only parse-able by people with significant experience with building, but the novel parts are possible to appreciate without this background.  
Requirements: Orange 1, Craft, Construct, or Tech at 6 or higher  

### Purple Books  

#### The Thief's Dream  
Purple 2  
A collection of dream journals written by an anonymous self professed master burglar. No hints to their identity, nor credentials cited: you're apparently just going to have to trust them on that part.  
Requirements: Purple 1, Awareness, Sabotage, or Stealth 6 or higher  

### Silver Books

#### Getting your Bearings  
Silver 2

#### The Quintessential Quiet Quill  
Silver 2/Blue 2

#### The Wrath of a Gentle God; when the Laughter Stops  
Pink 2/Silver 2  
The book begins with an account of what the Laughing Light is; boiling it down to a force of clarity. It reveals the inner workings of the universe to those who stand within it, and most of the time the revelation is humorous or joyful to the subject, often prompting fits of laughter or inspiring the one in the light to share an insightful or humorous story. But on chapter three the book takes a dark turn...  
Requirements: Empathy 8, plus Lore 6 or Perform 6
