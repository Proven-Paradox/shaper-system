# Tricks

Tricks represent minor things a character can do that don’t affect combat, but make life a little easier. Many Tricks will only be appropriate in fantasy or sci-fi settings, but some of these can work in more grounded settings. They can represent anything from fine control over fire magic to reliably having a lighter. Tricks can either be purchased in sets of 3 for 1 XP, or come along with some Abilities or Lessons. If you spend XP to learn some Tricks and later learn an Ability or Lesson that grants a Trick you already know, you may learn a new Trick. Once learned, a Trick can be used at will. The Tricks available (along with any Abilities/Lessons that grant them for free) are described below.  

#### Chill  
You can generate a feeling of cold. This can a small ice spell, triggering an endothermic chemical reaction, or something similar. If the cold comes from a device, it can be assumed to always have fuel. You are immune to discomfort from your own Chill, and the cold--though deeply uncomfortable--is not strong enough to cause HP damage. The chill is not enough to counteract hot weather. This can be used to chill drinks, make ice, preserve food, or similar applications.

#### Clean  
You can quickly clean a surface. This can be magically wiping away dirt and grime, setting a robotic assistant to the task, or something similar. This cleaning does not repair any damage done to the object or assemble anything taken apart, but dirt, rust, mold, and any other sort of non-magical grime comes away quickly when this Trick is used. This can also be used to dry off wet surfaces. Clean can be used safely on living creatures without harming them.

#### Lift  
You can manipulate objects from a distance. This can be due to magical or psychic power, having drones with manipulator arms, or something similar. For the purposes of how much can be lifted, treat Lift as having Strength -1. If the force comes from a device, it can be assumed to always have fuel. Lift cannot be used to take an item from another creature’s person or to manipulate tiny creatures.

#### Light  
You can generate light. This can be a radiant spell, carrying a flashlight, or something similar. If the light comes from a device, it can be assumed to always have fuel. You can cause the light to radiate outward, in which case it illuminates Squares all around you out to Close range (about 20 feet), or to shine out like a cone or flashlight, in which case it illuminates Squares in a direction out to Long range (about 60 feet). This light does not penetrate magical darkness.

#### Mend  
You can fix minor damage done to items. This can be magically willing the damage to be fixed or having the tools and know-how to do the repairs manually. This only repairs small amounts of damage--a tear in cloth, a dent in armor, a crack in glass, and so on. If the object in question is actually broken, Mend is ineffective.  
Granted By: Healing Word, Healing Touch

#### Shadow  
You can create shadowy figures or manipulate your shadow unnaturally. This can be sneaky usage of darkness magic, employing holograms, or similar procedures. When producing an image, it can occupy an area up to a cube with four foot sides. It can be as detailed and colorful as you like, but it will always be slightly transparent. It cannot produce light. When manipulating your shadow, you can cause it to take a different shape, produce faces or symbols on it, increase its size up to 50%, decrease its size up to 50%, or similar effects.

#### Spark  
You can generate a small flame. This can be a flame you light on your finger with fire magic, a simple lighter you keep in your gear, or something similar. If the flame comes from a device, it can be assumed to always have fuel. You are immune to harm from your own Spark, and the flame generated is not hot enough to cause HP damage, though it is still painful to touch for others. The warmth it provides is not enough to exist comfortably in low temperatures. This spark is enough to ignite flammable substances as normal.  
Granted By: Elemental Attunement (Fire)

#### Sprout  
You can grow and manipulate plants. This can be a gentle application of earth or sylvan magic, a chemical concoction that causes rapid plant growth, or something similar. You can assume you always have the materials you need to perform this Trick. If working from nothing, you can cause small amounts of moss, grasses, or vines to grow, along with a single flower of whatever color you desire. If working from a seed or an existing plant, you can cause the seed to sprout, blooms to grow or change color, leaves and branches to grow, fruit to ripen, or damage to heal. (This does not heal HP damage dealt to plant-like creatures.) This Trick is not enough to grow food on its own but if used on existing crop plants it can double the rate at which they grow. Sprout cannot render poisonous plants safe to eat.  
Granted By: Elemental Attunement (Earth)

#### Static  
You can generate small electric shocks. This can be subtle use of air magic, a glove that stores and releases electric charge, or something similar. If the electricity comes from a device, it can be assumed to always have fuel. You are immune to discomfort from your own Static, and the voltage generated is not enough to cause HP damage--though it can still be a painful surprise. This Trick can be used to power small devices or recharge batteries, but anything larger than two feet in diameter requires a dedicated power source to function continuously.
