# RECONFIGURING

This module goes over reconfiguration. This can represent metamorphic abilities, reconfiguring technology, or just adapting a different stance.

## Ability

#### Reconfigure  
Auxiliary  
Action: Major  
Prerequisites: None  
Range: None  
Targets: Self  
Cost: 3 MP or 6 HP per rearranged [Attribute](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md#step-1-attributes) (Upkeep: 1 MP or 2 HP per rearranged Attribute, chosen per round)  
Effect: You may rearrange up to 2 points of your Attributes. 
For example, a character with [Strength 2, Toughness 2, Finesse 0, Mind 1, Heart -1, Soul 1] can take  two points from Finesse to gain Strength and Toughness, making their physical Attributes [Strength 3, Toughness 3, Finesse -2]. Their associated [Point Stats](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md#step-2-a-point-stats), [Offense/Defense](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md#step-2-b-offensedefense), and [Initiative](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md#initiative) are modified accordingly.  
The round after you use Reconfigure, you act based on your new Initiative bonus. This can the order in which you act.  
You may not rearrange your Attributes in such a way that you go to less than 1 HP or MP. If your MP would go to negative numbers as a result of ending your Upkeep of this Ability, you go to 0 MP and lose 3 times the difference in HP. If dropping Reconfigure would cause you to go into negative HP, you take additional [Injuries](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md#initiative) for every 10 additional damage you have taken below 0.  
This can only be done during combat.  
Description: Temporarily shifting yourself to new attributes. This could be as simple as shifting your stance, or as elaborate as transformation magic or reconfiguring a robotic body.  

>> If you take this Ability, it is very important that you note your normal attributes on your sheet somewhere. If you're using the default character sheet, you can make changes on the Attribute fields and the associated  will automatically update. Also, because this can affect your max HP and MP it is more practical to count damage taken/MP spent instead of HP/MP remaining. The character sheet is already formatted to do that.

## Lessons

#### Quick Metamorpher  
Prerequisite: [Reconfigure](#reconfigure) Ability  
You may use Reconfigure as a Minor action. If you do this, you may only rearrange 1 Attribute.

>> Note that you can use Reconfigure as a Minor action additional times to rearrange multiple Attributes over multiple rounds.

#### Safe Metamorpher
Prerequisite: [Reconfigure](#reconfigure) Ability  
If you would go into negative MP as a result of ending your Reconfigure, you lose 2 HP per negative MP instead of 3.  
If you would go into negative HP as a result of ending your Reconfigure, you take additional Injuries for ever 12 negative HP instead of 10.
