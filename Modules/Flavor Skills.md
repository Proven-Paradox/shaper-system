# Flavor Skills

The Core Skills may determine whether or not a character survives a given situation. They can reflect some things about a characters’ personality, but are also important to consider from a mechanical standpoint. Not all skills have to be this way however. If allowed by the Arbiter, all characters start with 8 flavor skill points. You have half as many flavor skill points as regular ones. (Reminder that all fractions round down.) These can only be put into Skills that flesh out the character’s personality, reflecting hobbies or a trade that they have outside of their adventuring. Checks involving these skills may only come up rarely, and are not meant to solve real problems the character will face. The following list contains some examples, but by no means all of them. Players should talk with their Arbiter if something they think their character would want to be good at isn’t on this list.

#### Academics (Type)  
Attributes: Mind, Heart  
Advanced knowledge about a specific subject, as well as the knowledge of how to handle oneself in academic spaces for the subject. For example, in a modern/sci-fi setting this could represent a degree from a university. In medieval settings, this could represent an unusual opportunity to learn more than average peasants. Examples of types include Literature, Mathematics, Computer Science, Psychology, ect.

#### Art  
Attributes: Heart, Soul  
Painting, poetry, writing. In general this skill represents your ability to create works of art.

#### Cooking  
Attributes: Heart, Soul  
Making food look and taste better, faster. This could represent spending time as a cook at a restaurant, gourmet studies, or just a lot of time in a kitchen trying things and seeing what works.

#### Gambling  
Attributes: Finesse, Mind  
Calculating odds on the fly. Knowing how to bend the rules of a given game to improve one’s payout. If the character would go that far, cheating.

#### Gaming (Dexterity)  
Attributes: Finesse, Mind  
Knowing how to throw the ball or hit the puck just right. This covers games like horseshoes, darts, pool, Crokinole, and similar games.

#### Gaming (Strategic)  
Attributes: Toughness, Mind  
Learning rules quickly and bending them to your purposes on the fly. Seeing opportunities. Min/maxing. This covers games like Chess, Civilization, Eurogames, and the like.

#### Music (Instrument)  
Attributes: Finesse, Heart  
Technical skill with a given instrument. Instruments include violin, voice, guitar, trumpet, flute, synths, ect.
> Perform vs. Music: A performance can be made without an instrument or music at all. Perform checks represent one’s ability to captivate an audience by whatever means you can. It may be that you use a Music check as a part of a Perform check. In this case you make the Music check first, and if it goes well it may confer a benefit to the Perform check while a poor result will impose penalties.

#### Sport (Type)  
Attributes: Strength, Toughness  
Skill and experience playing a given sport. Types include football, baseball, basketball, and so on.
> Athletics vs. Sport: Generally speaking, an Athletics check should be made as part of all Sport checks, adding a benefit to the Sport check if it’s good and a penalty if it’s bad. People who know the fine details of the rules and who have studied the best techniques should have an advantage over opponents lacking that practice, so a character with Sport checks should have a significantly higher chance to win a given event than someone competing with raw Athletics.

#### Trade (Type)  
Attributes: Toughness, Mind  
Knowing how to make a living in a given business. This can represent any profession that doesn’t really fit into one of the other skills. Example Types include Waiter, Handyman, Merchant, Doctor, Herbalist.
> This Skill is focused on the business side of things. For example, a character may have very high Medicine skill that makes them able to provide a valuable service, but if they have no points in Trade (Doctor) they would struggle with paperwork and business decisions that they need to make to have a profitable business from their practice.
