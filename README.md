# Story Shaper System

Welcome to the Git repository for my Story Shaper System. Please keep in mind as you read through that these are living documents; changes will be made and content will be added as time passes.

The primary document in this repo is the [Handbook](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md). This is the rulebook which describes how to play.

In the [Character Sheets Folder](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/tree/main/Character-Sheets) you can find an Excel spreadsheet that represents a [blank character sheet](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Character-Sheets/blank.xls). This sheet has been set up to do as much of the math for you as possible.

For a list of generic monsters, see [Adversaries and Monsters](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Adversaries-and-Monsters.md).

The [Modules](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/tree/main/Modules) directory lists some optional rules that can be added to the game if you like.
