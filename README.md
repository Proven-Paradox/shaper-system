# Story Shaper System

Welcome to the Git repository for my Story Shaper System! I hope you enjoy my game.

Please keep in mind as you read through that these are **living documents**; changes will be made and content will be added as time passes. (You can click on the History button on the top right of documents to see when changes have been made and what they were.)

## What I need from you

This system is in the tabletop rules equivalent of an open beta test. I want you to take the rules I've made and run games with them. 

If you're here as a player, you'll find everything you need (besides a pair of d10s) in the [Story Shaper Handbook]([Handbook](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md). This is where all the stuff a player would need to know is kept.

If you're here as an Arbiter (this system's equivalent to GM, DM, ST, and the like) then your job is a little harder. There is currently no documentation for the Arbiter separate from the players'. You'll use the same rules as the players for the most part, but things about scenario design, dungeons, towns, settings--all of that is up to you. I want you to run your game, and tell me spots where you need more information. The next phase of this project is going to be writing a book that addresses what an Arbiter needs to run this system. In order to write that, I need feedback on the kinds of things Arbiters need.

The primary document in this repo is the [Handbook](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md). This is the rulebook which describes how to play.

In the [Character Sheets Folder](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/tree/main/Character-Sheets) you can find an Excel spreadsheet that represents a [blank character sheet](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Character-Sheets/blank.xls). This sheet has been set up to do as much of the math for you as possible.

For a list of generic monsters, see [Adversaries and Monsters](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Adversaries-and-Monsters.md).

The [Modules](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/tree/main/Modules) directory lists some optional rules that can be added to the game if you like.
