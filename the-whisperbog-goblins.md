Whisperbog presentation

# Purpose
The Whisperbog goblins are one of two major cultures involved in my adventure. This document is aimed at game masters (called the Arbiter in my system). The goal is to prepare them to embody this culture for players at their table. This gives the Arbiter answers to common or predictable situations and help them understand these people well enough to handle unexpected situations. "You" refers to the Arbiter.

# Goblin Culture
The word "goblin" translates literally to "swamp folk." To be clear, the goblins do not own the swamp; rather, the swamp owns the goblins. They have been living in the Whisperbog for generations and have carved out a comfortable niche. They use structures they call floating gardens to do their agriculture (based on real life [chinampas](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/chinampas-mexico-indigenous-and-highly-sustainable-agriculture-system#:~:text=The%20chinampas%20agricultural%20system%20is,the%20time%20of%20the%20Aztecs) .) These allow them to cultivate large quantities and varieties of plant produce; unless a crop specifically needs dry conditions, the goblins can create ideal conditions for it. The canals are also great fishing. For livestock, they raise ducks (and prefer the taste of duck egg to chicken egg usually), goats, and frogs, some of which are large enough to serve as mounts. They also raise crickets to feed to the frogs and ducks, as for fish bait.  

The average goblin is apathetic to the outside world. They welcome outsiders when they visit and display exceptional hospitality, but if one asks a random goblin to come visit outside the swamp they would probably decline, wondering why they'd go elsewhere when they have more than enough here. They occasionally send a small group of traders to Redwater to buy silver or luxury goods, but that's as far as most go. Goblins that travel further are rare. Such adventurers are welcome back to the community when they return, but they are be considered eccentric for the rest of their days.  

Goblin religion is a mixture of druidic veneration of the swamp and spiritual veneration of their ancestors. They see the Whisperbog as a generous but easily offended entity. The swamp provides lots of food from their floating gardens, fish, livestock, and occasional hunting trips; they will never go hungry. But it is quick to punish poor judgement: there are lots of dangerous plants and animals in the swamp, and it's very easy to get lost and never find one's way back to shelter. During funerals, they return the deceased's corpse to the swamp by leaving the remains in a body of water away from town. Goblin families usually have a preferred lake, pond, or river. Individuals sometimes specify a specific spot in their last wishes. In the afterlife they join their ancestors in eternal rest and/or feast. They believe the deceased leave their memories in their skull after death, which the goblins display in their catacombs as a memorial. Some goblins spend time in the catacombs seeking advice from their enshrined ancestors. Superficially it looks like the goblins are just chopping heads off corpses and dumping them into the swamp, resulting in a common misconception that they have no respect for their dead.  

Goblins have no concept of visual beauty. Their language has no words like "pretty" or a expressions about "looking good." If the concept comes up they would find the idea strange and nonsensical. To goblins, things look how they look, and it's not important except for identification. They would be particularly confused about the idea being applied to people, noting immediately (and with distaste) that the existence of pretty people implies the existence of people who aren't pretty. ([Worldwalker](#worldwalker), [Spiritsinger](#spiritsinger), and [Queen Gatortooth](#queen-gatortooth) have enough exposure to the outside world to be familiar with the idea. These three don't like the concept, but would try to diplomatically accept compliments or try to change subjects if it came up.) They decorate and accessorize, but this usually has a symbolic meaning to their wearers. For example, a couple might get a matching pair of anklets to mark their relationship, or a parent might get ear piercings representing each of their children.  

There are a couple of jail cells in the town--for rowdy drunkards to sober up, containing someone causing violence, or similar disruptions to the peace--but there are no prisons. Goblins find long-term imprisonment barbaric, worse than death. Goblins who commit crimes are punished with less or lower quality food, unpleasant or difficult labor around town, temporary pariah-hood, beatings (most goblins wouldn't admit this one to outsiders), or in the most extreme case, exile. If [Two of Blades] ((a bandit the PCs will encounter on the way to Gobnatoon)) ends up a goblin prisoner, they are firmly against returning him to Redwater to be imprisoned.  

Technologically and magically they are comparable to the rest of the world, but this isn't apparent from the outside. For example, goblins know how to produce gunpowder and have a few guns in their armory, but they do not use firearms except to defend the town. Goblin hunters prefer bows, spears, and slings because the sound of the gunfire scares away other prey. A hunter might say, "If you miss with a bow, you lose one meal. If you miss with a gun, you lose all the meals in a kilometer" or some equivalent. Gunpowder also tends to have problems if it gets wet; not ideal in a swamp. There would be other technologies where goblins have the option, but think what is given up or damaged by the outside worlds' techniques are not worth the benefits. Their access to magic should mirror the rest of your setting.  

## Goblin linguistics  
Goblins language doesn't have a proper name for itself. If asked what language they're speaking, most goblins would reply with confusion or "lin," which translates to "folk" or "person." They're trying to say, "we're talking like people," in contrast to animals and plants. They refer to other languages as "reglin," literally "other folk," "the way other people speak." Goblins who know enough Common to communicate without an interpreter would call their language Goblin, i.e. "we're talking like swamp-people."  

In addition, Goblin has no words to modify magnitude like "very," "extreme," "a lot," "a little." Instead they repeat the word twice or thrice to describe magnitude. To decrease the force of an adjective or adverb, they add the prefix "tik" to the word. This is most likely to come while speaking to [Fourfinger](#fourfinger) since her command of Common is weak; she would repeat adjectives or adverbs until she is corrected gets an explanation. (Lala ((an NPC accompanying the PCs who can speak Goblin)) can explain this in Goblin if the PCs struggle/don't want to.) For "a little," Fourfinger says "small-<adjective>."  

Goblin choose their names and can change them whenever. Most name themselves after something they have done (Worldwalker), something they think is important (Warrior), or a physical feature (Fourfinger). They don't have surnames and don't understand why outsiders need more than one name. They also find it odd that outsiders' names generally don't say anything about the person.  

If you want to give them an accent, Goblin doesn't use the "ch" sound of Common/English. Goblins speaking with an accent pronounce a "k" sound instead. They also draw out vowel sounds, especially "a." ([Worldwalker](#worldwalker) has no Goblin accent. [Spiritsinger](#spiritsinger) and [Queen Gatortooth](#queen-gatortooh) have a slight accent. All others would either not speak Common at all or speak with a heavy accent.  

# Characters

## Fourfinger  
Profession: Trapper, angler  
Short version: A hunter the PCs may encounter on the way to Gobnatoon. She's a normal goblin and serves as a contrast to the more colorful NPCs the party will deal with on their quest.  

Description:  
Fourfinger is short by goblins standards, but with a broad and sturdy build. She has purple eyes, light green skin, and mid-back length red hair pulled into a pony-tail. She has four visible piercings: one through her nose, two on the upper ridge of her left ear, and one large hole in the lobe of her right ear. Most are occupied by simple bone or iron hoops, but the right ear piercing is empty. She wears drab, simple clothing made of leather hides. Her left hand lacks a ring finger.  

Story Role:  
If the group ends up negotiating with Two of Blades for guidance to the hunter's camp, Fourfinger is among the first goblins the PCs meet. She is the only goblin at the camp who knows any Common, so she speaks to the PCs on behalf of the hunters. She can answer a lot of the PCs' first questions about goblin life. She's also very comfortable with boats and would happily take care of driving the group from the hunter's camp to Gobnatoon.  

If the PCs skip the hunters' encampment, she enters the story once the PCs make it to Gobnatoon on their own. She can help show the PCs around or answer questions when Worldwalker has to be elsewhere or if the PCs split up.  
If the goblins end up detaining Two of Blades, she will watch him to make sure he is reasonably comfortable and doesn't escape while captive.  

Background:  
Fourfinger has lived a pleasant and unremarkable life. She was born in the swamp and has no reason to leave. She can do a little bit of everything that needs to be done in town, but she is particularly good at weaving and placing traps for crabs, crawfish, and the like. She finds the methodical weaving process meditative and she knows the best places to put those traps. She is also good at spear fishing.  
She learned Common from Worldwalker. She is not fluent and struggles with grammar, but she can keep up with most conversations.  

Personality:  
Left to her own devices she is quiet and withdrawn. She thinks a lot more than she says, but will share those thoughts openly if asked. She is not at all curious about life outside the swamp, and only asks questions if something odd comes up in conversation.  

Her Common is rough. She needs clarification for complex or rare words and makes grammatical errors. In particular, she would repeat adjectives instead of using the word "very." So if she were referring to a huge fish she would say, "a big big BIG fish" instead of "a very big fish."  

Motives and goals:  
Fourfinger just wants to live peacefully and quietly. She has competing urges to be helpful and to fade into the background. The former tends to win out more often but in this scenario she steps up: her language knowledge makes her the best person in the hunting group for the situation. She does her best to help the PCs understand her people's culture and mindset. She wants to give a welcoming impression for her people, but isn't fully prepared for the task.  

Details:  
* Fourfinger earned her name as a child in an encounter with a snapping turtle.  
* She and Two of Blades have traded with each other in the past and have a slight rapport. (Two also has a taste for seafood that she appreciates.) If Two ends up a prisoner of Gobnatoon, Fourfinger is chosen as his guard; her mediocre Common plus Two's mediocre Goblin make it easier for them to communicate.  
* Her nose piercing is made of a bone from the biggest fish she ever caught. The rings in her left ear represent siblings; a younger brother and sister. The right earring was a symbol of an ex lover before the relationship went bad. She would share all these details.  
  * If asked about the bad relationship, she would just shrug and say, "Learned much from it. Hole in ear, helps me remember." She doesn't share further details.  
* She's one of Gobnatoon's better boat pilots and does respectably in boat races.  

## Queen Gatortooth  
Name: Gatortooth  
Profession: Goblin royalty, formerly pest control  
Short version: The goblins' leader. She is the primary figure the PCs need to negotiate with. She also asks the PCs to enter the catacombs to deal with their undead problem.  

Description:  
Queen Gatortooth is above average goblin height, with a lean, athletic build. She has gray eyes, a small nose, dark green skin, and no hair. Her long ears are heavily, asymmetrically pierced, a dozen or more loops or studs poking out of each ear. She wears thick alligator hide armor with decorative studs made from alligator teeth.  

Story Role:  
The goblins' ruler; her job is to see to Gobnatoon's prosperity. The PCs need to negotiate with her to complete their mission. If the group makes it to her with most of Redwater's offering, she acknowledges the generosity and makes it clear there is no hard feelings over the quarrel that started this whole mess and wants to come to an agreement. But the way she assigns value to things is out of sync with Redwater in a way that makes negotiations difficult. Redwater's offer contains materials that will be used and then spent, and she values the long-term benefit of the land Redwater wants more than the town's (otherwise generous!) offers.  

Once initial negotiations are tabled for everyone involved to deliberate, she asks for the PCs help in the catacombs.  

Background:  
Gatortooth has only been queen for about two years. Before that she kept dangerous animals and pests out of town. As her name and attire imply, she was particularly good at dealing with alligators. She'd also handle venomous snakes, insect infestations, particularly large and grumpy snapping turtles, and the occasional monster. The work took her all over town, so she became acquainted with everyone. There are a lot of swamp critters the goblins don't want in their village, and they get everywhere. She also took the time to attend assemblies at the [Amphitheater](#gobnatoon-amphitheater) on occasion, just to hear what everyone was up to.  

Then the previous queen decided it was time to retire and directed the town to select her successor. Selecting a new monarch involves determining who knows the most about the village. Gatortooth came up early in this discussion. She knew the floating gardens because she kept them free of predatory animals. She knew most of the houses because she had cleared insects them. She knew much of the surrounding swamp from her going on patrol for dangerous beasts. And she had learned much from attending previous town meetings.  

When first nominated, Gatortooth rejected the position thinking she was not smart enough. The former queen and [Worldwalker](#worldwalker) urged her to participate despite her reticence. Part of selecting a new monarch is answering questions about current events in town, and here Gatortooth demonstrated her expertise. Not just to the town, but to herself. At the end of the process, she was selected to be the next queen. She has since settled into the position and kept the town running smoothly.  

Personality:  
Focused, serious, straightforward, brusque. On the one hand, she makes a point to listen more than she speaks. On the other, she has little patience for small talk, flattery, or complex phrasing. If things are going off track, she will tell speakers to get to the point. She is also aggressively humble, deflecting complements and downplaying her own importance.  

She wants to operate honestly and openly, but only if the people she's working with do the same. She is better at projecting power than being deceptive; if someone is evasive or untrustworthy, she will respond with straightforward questions spoken in an intimidating tone.  

Motives and goals:  
Gobnatoon's long term safety and prosperity is at the center of everything Gatortooth does.  

That said, she doesn't quite believe she is up to leading the town. She's new enough in the role still that she hasn't really internalized her identity including "queen" quite yet. (A PC could sense this uncertainty with an Empathy check of at least 20.) Her first two years on the throne were unremarkable, so the situation in the Catacombs is the first real test of her ability as a ruler. She is under a lot of (mostly self-imposed) pressure.  

Details:  
* She found her work in pest control fulfilling. Occasionally even exhilarating. This is another reason she initially declined the throne. In times where she doesn't have many meetings to attend, she will occasionally go on patrol with the pest control squad for old times' sake.  
* She started learning Common from Worldwalker the day after she was crowned, specifically in preparation to deal with issues relating to the outside world. She also had him teach her the social skills she would need on the throne; while their main purpose is to listen, kings and queens need to do more talking than pest control workers.  
* She puts a lot of trust into Worldwalker and Warrior, who have both been very helpful to her rule. She wishes Worldwalker would more serious and wishes Warrior would less.
