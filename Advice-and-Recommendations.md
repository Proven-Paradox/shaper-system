# Story Shaper System Advice  
This document is supplemental material for the Story Shaper System, and assumes you are already familiar with the rules presented in the [Handbook](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md). I will be giving advice on how to have the best experience with the game here, covering aspects of running the game, creating characters, and designing encounters. This is completely optional reading: you are perfectly welcome to ignore this and do things your way.  
This will be broadly divided based on who the advice is targeting: one section for universal advice, one for advice for players, and one for Arbiters.
