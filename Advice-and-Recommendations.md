# Story Shaper System Advice  
This document is supplemental material for the Story Shaper System, and assumes you are already familiar with the rules presented in the [Handbook](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md). I will be giving advice on how to have the best experience with the game here, covering aspects of running the game, creating characters, and designing encounters. This is completely optional reading: you are perfectly welcome to ignore this and do things your way.  
This will be broadly divided based on who the advice is targeting: one section for universal advice, one for advice for players, and one for Arbiters.

### Character Creation

#### Attributes
If you’re struggling to come up with your Attribute arrangement, here are a few recommendations.  
* It is useful to have at least one high Attribute. This ensures your character can cover at least one major role in the party.  
> Generalized Attribute spreads still work. They are a bit more challenging to build, but can be very effective by mixing together options more specialized characters can't access.  

* Coordinate with other players at the table. There are several ways characters can interact that make all involved stronger. A character focused on support abilities can help a physical attacker do more damage, while a defensive character can provide cover for a fragile spellcaster. If the group features some players who want to fight monsters while others prefer non-combat scenarios, those players should discuss things they could do to support each other. The combat oriented players might take some specific options that let them cover an important area the non-combat players need help with, while the non-combat characters might take options that support the eager combatants.  
   * This can be an in-character process as well; a group of people who do perilous work together will figure out ways to keep each other safe.  
* Getting more defenses and HP is always useful. There are S3 builds that don't need Offense or Initiative, and even some that can work without MP. Defenses and HP are universally applicable. Therefore, if you have Attributes left over Toughness or Heart are always solid choices.  

### Combat 

#### Build Advice  
* You should have at least one Ability that fits within your character’s intended skill set, usually more. A Strength or Finesse dominant hero should have Attacks, while a Mind or Soul dominant hero will want Spells. A character focused on high defenses is most effective if they choose Abilities that protect allies and force enemies to target them first.  
  * Characters that aren't built for combat (or players who aren't interested in fights) can still contribute even if their combat strategy is to hide. Simple support Abilities like Empower, Fortify, and Healing Word can be used from cover. The players and characters itching for a fight will welcome the help.  
* That said, don’t overspecialize. If all of your attacks are Melee Range a foe with a gun will be a severe problem. If you have nothing but healing or support Abilities, then you will be helpless if you get separated from your allies. Once you have your core covered you should add some variety to your arsenal.  
* At first your HP and MP pool will be limited. Keep costs in mind when picking Abilities. If an Ability requires too much of your MP to use often, it might be better to set that aside until you've gotten stronger.  
* Once your major bases are covered, it is often useful to choose at least one Ability that requires a Minor Action to use. Doing so allows you to increase your effectiveness by letting you more consistently use both of your Actions.  
   * The same could be said for choosing at least one Ability that is a Counter Action, but Counters are more situational than Minor Actions.  
* Buy numbers! If you're using Attacks, increasing your Physical Offense will increase the damage of *every* Attack you use after. A point in Mental Defense means at least one less damage sustained from Spells for the rest of their career. A character with eight different Spells and no investment in Mental Offense will usually lose to a character who learned three Spells and spent the rest of that XP buying Offense or Defense.  

### Non-combat  

#### Skills  
* Skills are the portion of character creation most closely tied to roleplaying. Other aspects of the system have been intentionally separated from roleplay for flexibility, but your character's Skills should make sense from a story perspective. Think about the things a person with your character's history could do.  
   * Don't let that limit you though. Having an unusual or out of character Skill can be very compelling as well.  
* If you’re satisfied with your character’s representation but still have Skill Points remaining, consider coordinating with the other players. A given party would typically benefit from having most of their bases covered, so if you have points left and there's a major gap in the party's capabilities, it might help the whole group to use those spare points to fill that gap. (Explaining how your character comes to have said Skill could be an interesting prompt for extra details in your PC's background as well.)  
* If you're a combat oriented player, you can support your party by covering Skills that support other party members outside of fights. A witty orator's words carry more weight if there's an Intimidating warrior backing them up. Points in Drive can solve transportation problems for the whole group. Outside of battle, a trained war-mage could cover Lore or History for their group.  
* If you’ve done the above and still have Skill Points, then consider increasing Athletics, Acrobatics, Awareness, Composure, Empathy, or Endure. These Skills are either universally useful, reactive in nature, or beneficial for the party to have multiple members able to use them well.  

### During the game  
* Call for rolls  
* Help run the game  
  * Who's that NPC  
  * Inventory keeper  

## Arbiters  
* Small number changes can lead to big probability changes  
  * Triangle distribution discussion  
* Allowing a character to put all their points into one Attribute causes balance issues  
  * That's not necessarily a bad thing, but understand the implications  
* Try to give at least two options for Skills  
* Deputize players to help run fights  
* Don't spend too much time drawing maps for unplanned combat  
* The system kind of ends at level 10 for now  
* Giving XP  
* Encounter Design
