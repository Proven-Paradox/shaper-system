# DEPRICATED 
I have a policy of not deleting stuff I remove from the system. That said, old rules that aren't going to be used much don't belong in the handbook. This file is the repo for old rules that are no longer in the game. 

## Complicating Factors During a Chase
Different settings for a chase can influence how it goes significantly. A savvy theif might be well at home being chased through the streets of a busy city, but be terribly out of their depth when running through a forest. A seasoned ranger would find the situations reversed.
Lighting
Depending on how well lit the area is, Evasion might become harder or easier. The lighting conditions of a given area impose the following modifiers on the Evade action’s Stealth check.


Radiant
	Double Bane 8
	Very Bright
	Bane 9
	Bright
	Bane 10
	Average
	No modifier
	Dim
	Boon 1
	Dark
	Boon 2
	Pitch Black
	Double Boon 3
	Chase Complication Tables
Different environments should have different complications that might come up during a chase. These can be planned and narrated by the Arbiter, or they can come from a random table. In the previous case the work is all on the game runner, but for the latter, here are a few suggestions of randomized events. They should happen as often as the Arbiter deems necessary; never more than once a round though. Generally speaking, the Quarry should encounter these complications before the Hunters (meaning they are placed on Positions in front of the Quarry) though there are situations where that is not always the case.

A Crowd of People - It could be from a nearby market, the end of a factory’s workday, or a skilled street performer, but for whatever reason you are running into a place full of people. Moving through this square without one of the following actions requires both a Major and Minor action.
Quarry Options:
* Duck Through - You can attempt to skillfully duck through the crowds without disturbing them. This is a Major Action, during which you perform an Acrobatics check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On a success, you move forward a Position (through the crowds) and gain 1 Concealment. On a failure, you don’t move and lose 1 Concealment.
* Blend In - You can attempt to cannily blend into the crowd. This is a Major Action, during which you perform a Deception check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On a success, you gain 2 Concealment and can move through the crowd with just a Minor Action. On a failure, you lose 1 Concealment.
Hunter Options:
* Make Way! - You can attempt to bully the crowd apart. This is a Major Action, during which you perform an Intimidate check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On success, the crowd parts, allowing you and any other Hunters with you to move through it as a Minor Action.
* Which Way did They Go? - You can ask the crowd where your Quarry went. This is a Major Action, during which you perform an Investigation or Diplomacy check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On a success, you gain 2 Momentum and can move through the crowd as a Minor Action.


Blind Alleyway - It’s dark, off the beaten path. It might lead to a short cut, or it might be a dead end. The Arbiter decides this before the first character approaches it. The lighting conditions in the alleyway should be Dim at best, making it potentially a useful place to try to Evade.


Entering or exiting a Blind Alleyway take a minor action. If a Quarry makes it into a Blind Alleyway while at least 3 Positions ahead of its nearest Hunter, they gain 1 Concealment by ducking into it. They may only gain Concealment in this way once per chase.


The Alleyway could lead to a shortcut, a dead end, or just go back out into the streets. A character may attempt a Streetwise check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter to find out which. If it’s a shortcut, they may emerge at a Position 3 greater than they went in when they exit the alleyway. If it’s a dead end, exiting the alleyway causes you to emerge at the same Position as when you went in. If it’s neither, then exiting the alley means you may emerge up to 2 Positions greater than when you went in.


Sharp Turn - This turn gives Quarry who are far enough ahead of their Hunters a moment to slip out of sight. If a Quarry makes it to a position with a Sharp Turn at least 3 positions ahead of their nearest Hunter, they gain 1 Concealment.


Busy Street - Whether it’s full of horse-drawn cars, cars, or hovercraft, you’ve reached a spot where you need to cross a perilous road.
Options -
* Carefully cross - this requires a Major and Minor Action. You cross the streets safely, but lose progress in the process. Lose either 2 Momentum or 2 Concealment.
* Dash through - This requires a Minor Action, and also spends one point of Endurance. Make an Acrobatics or Athletics check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter.. On a success, you make it through safely. On a failure, you suffer an Injury from being struck (or very nearly struck) by a passing vehicle.
* Watch for an Opportunity - This requires a Major action and requires an Awareness or Drive check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On a success, you cross successfully. On a failure, you do not cross but are able to avoid injuring yourself.


Stack of Heavy Things - Less a complication and more an opportunity, this represents crossing near a stack of things that might inhibit pursuers.
Quarry Options -
* Knock it over - This requires a Minor action and an Athletics, Sabotage, or Construct check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On a success, you knock the heavy things over into the path of your Hunters.
Hunter Options -
All of these options are for if the Quarry has knocked these over. Otherwise, there’s no obstacle in the way.
* Climb Over - This requires a Major and Minor action and gets the Hunter around the obstacle. It costs 1 Momentum to do this.
* Barge Through - This requires a Major and Minor action and requires an Athletics check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. It also costs 1 Endurance. On successfully completing the check, you move through the obstacle and clear it out for other Hunters to pass through easily.


Sharp Incline - Just a twist in the path that makes it harder to run through. When this complication comes up, the next position the Quarry enters is marked as uphill. Running uphill requires the Endure check made to keep from losing a point of Endurance at Double Bane 8.

## Mobility Track

* **Level 3** - When you move as a Minor action, you can move one more square.
* **Level 2** - Your mobility improves your ability to dodge. If an opponent tries to strike you, they have Double Bane 9. If your foe already has a equal or stronger source of Double Bane, you may instead increase its magnitude by one level (so from Double Bane 8 to Double Bane 7).
* **Level 1** - When you move as a Major action, you can move one more square. This stacks with any other effect that increases your movement, such as the Swift Hero’s Dash Maneuver.
* **Level 0** - Normal, no changes.
* **Level -1** - You can no longer move as a minor action.
* **Level -2** - Your lack of mobility gives enemies an easier target. Abilities that requires attack rolls used against you are made with Double Boon 2. If your foe already has an equal or stronger source of Double Boon, they may instead increase its magnitude by one (so from Double Boon 2 to Double Boon 3).
* **Level -3** - You must spend both your Minor and Major action to move one square.
