# DEPRICATED 
I have a policy of not deleting stuff I remove from the system. That said, old rules that aren't going to be used much don't belong in the handbook. This file is the repo for old rules that are no longer in the game. 

## Complicating Factors During a Chase
Different settings for a chase can influence how it goes significantly. A savvy theif might be well at home being chased through the streets of a busy city, but be terribly out of their depth when running through a forest. A seasoned ranger would find the situations reversed.
Lighting
Depending on how well lit the area is, Evasion might become harder or easier. The lighting conditions of a given area impose the following modifiers on the Evade action’s Stealth check.


Radiant
	Double Bane 8
	Very Bright
	Bane 9
	Bright
	Bane 10
	Average
	No modifier
	Dim
	Boon 1
	Dark
	Boon 2
	Pitch Black
	Double Boon 3
	Chase Complication Tables
Different environments should have different complications that might come up during a chase. These can be planned and narrated by the Arbiter, or they can come from a random table. In the previous case the work is all on the game runner, but for the latter, here are a few suggestions of randomized events. They should happen as often as the Arbiter deems necessary; never more than once a round though. Generally speaking, the Quarry should encounter these complications before the Hunters (meaning they are placed on Positions in front of the Quarry) though there are situations where that is not always the case.

A Crowd of People - It could be from a nearby market, the end of a factory’s workday, or a skilled street performer, but for whatever reason you are running into a place full of people. Moving through this square without one of the following actions requires both a Major and Minor action.
Quarry Options:
* Duck Through - You can attempt to skillfully duck through the crowds without disturbing them. This is a Major Action, during which you perform an Acrobatics check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On a success, you move forward a Position (through the crowds) and gain 1 Concealment. On a failure, you don’t move and lose 1 Concealment.
* Blend In - You can attempt to cannily blend into the crowd. This is a Major Action, during which you perform a Deception check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On a success, you gain 2 Concealment and can move through the crowd with just a Minor Action. On a failure, you lose 1 Concealment.
Hunter Options:
* Make Way! - You can attempt to bully the crowd apart. This is a Major Action, during which you perform an Intimidate check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On success, the crowd parts, allowing you and any other Hunters with you to move through it as a Minor Action.
* Which Way did They Go? - You can ask the crowd where your Quarry went. This is a Major Action, during which you perform an Investigation or Diplomacy check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On a success, you gain 2 Momentum and can move through the crowd as a Minor Action.


Blind Alleyway - It’s dark, off the beaten path. It might lead to a short cut, or it might be a dead end. The Arbiter decides this before the first character approaches it. The lighting conditions in the alleyway should be Dim at best, making it potentially a useful place to try to Evade.


Entering or exiting a Blind Alleyway take a minor action. If a Quarry makes it into a Blind Alleyway while at least 3 Positions ahead of its nearest Hunter, they gain 1 Concealment by ducking into it. They may only gain Concealment in this way once per chase.


The Alleyway could lead to a shortcut, a dead end, or just go back out into the streets. A character may attempt a Streetwise check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter to find out which. If it’s a shortcut, they may emerge at a Position 3 greater than they went in when they exit the alleyway. If it’s a dead end, exiting the alleyway causes you to emerge at the same Position as when you went in. If it’s neither, then exiting the alley means you may emerge up to 2 Positions greater than when you went in.


Sharp Turn - This turn gives Quarry who are far enough ahead of their Hunters a moment to slip out of sight. If a Quarry makes it to a position with a Sharp Turn at least 3 positions ahead of their nearest Hunter, they gain 1 Concealment.


Busy Street - Whether it’s full of horse-drawn cars, cars, or hovercraft, you’ve reached a spot where you need to cross a perilous road.
Options -
* Carefully cross - this requires a Major and Minor Action. You cross the streets safely, but lose progress in the process. Lose either 2 Momentum or 2 Concealment.
* Dash through - This requires a Minor Action, and also spends one point of Endurance. Make an Acrobatics or Athletics check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter.. On a success, you make it through safely. On a failure, you suffer an Injury from being struck (or very nearly struck) by a passing vehicle.
* Watch for an Opportunity - This requires a Major action and requires an Awareness or Drive check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On a success, you cross successfully. On a failure, you do not cross but are able to avoid injuring yourself.


Stack of Heavy Things - Less a complication and more an opportunity, this represents crossing near a stack of things that might inhibit pursuers.
Quarry Options -
* Knock it over - This requires a Minor action and an Athletics, Sabotage, or Construct check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. On a success, you knock the heavy things over into the path of your Hunters.
Hunter Options -
All of these options are for if the Quarry has knocked these over. Otherwise, there’s no obstacle in the way.
* Climb Over - This requires a Major and Minor action and gets the Hunter around the obstacle. It costs 1 Momentum to do this.
* Barge Through - This requires a Major and Minor action and requires an Athletics check at a difficulty privately decided by the Arbiter. It also costs 1 Endurance. On successfully completing the check, you move through the obstacle and clear it out for other Hunters to pass through easily.


Sharp Incline - Just a twist in the path that makes it harder to run through. When this complication comes up, the next position the Quarry enters is marked as uphill. Running uphill requires the Endure check made to keep from losing a point of Endurance at Double Bane 8.

## Mobility Track

* **Level 3** - When you move as a Minor action, you can move one more square.
* **Level 2** - Your mobility improves your ability to dodge. If an opponent tries to strike you, they have Double Bane 9. If your foe already has a equal or stronger source of Double Bane, you may instead increase its magnitude by one level (so from Double Bane 8 to Double Bane 7).
* **Level 1** - When you move as a Major action, you can move one more square. This stacks with any other effect that increases your movement, such as the Swift Hero’s Dash Maneuver.
* **Level 0** - Normal, no changes.
* **Level -1** - You can no longer move as a minor action.
* **Level -2** - Your lack of mobility gives enemies an easier target. Abilities that requires attack rolls used against you are made with Double Boon 2. If your foe already has an equal or stronger source of Double Boon, they may instead increase its magnitude by one (so from Double Boon 2 to Double Boon 3).
* **Level -3** - You must spend both your Minor and Major action to move one square.

**Slow**  
Attack/Spell [Curse] [Overload] (See Special)  
Action: Major (Overload Minor)  
Prerequisites: None  
Range: Medium  
Targets: One enemy  
Cost: 1 MP (Overload 4 MP)  
Duration: None  
Effect: The target loses one point on the Mobility Track.  
Special: If you pay the Overload cost, you may use this ability as a minor action.  
You may use this either as an Attack (using your Physical Attack and targeting your opponent’s Physical Defense) or a Spell (using your Mental Attack to target you’re opponent’s Mental Defense).

Action: Minor  
Prerequisites: None  
Targets: Self  
Cost: 2 HP  
Effect: Increase your Mobility Track by 1.  
Description: Taking a moment of preparation or focusing to increase your mobility. This could be doing stretches to ready your limbs, drinking a potion that improves your ability to run, activating servos in a mechanical limb, or similar methods of enhancing mobility.

## Double Boon/Bane

The more extreme versions of Boon and Bane, Double Boon and Double Bane simply extend the effect to both dice. A character with Double Boon X may reroll one or both dice if either of them land on a number equal to or less than X. A character with Double Bane Y must reroll any dice that exceed Y. Examples:
* Hannah wants to deliver a swift kick to a foe with Double Boon 2. She rolls a 1 and a 4, and takes the available reroll. The result is another 1, for a final of 4 + 1 = 5.
* Kisuke is examining a crime scene looking for clues, but with Double Bane 9. He rolls a 9 and a 10, and is forced to reroll both, getting a 4 and a 5, 4 + 5 = 9 plus his modifier.
### Order of Operations
In complex situations, a roll may be made with a combination of Boon, Bane, Double Boon, or Double Bane. Having more than two types of modifiers should be relatively rare. In this case, the order of operations is:
* Double Bane
* Bane
* Double Boon
* Boon

Here are a couple of examples:
* Agni is attacking with a spell. He has Bane 8 and Double Boon 1. He rolls his dice, getting a 9 and a 10. Bane 8 forces him to reroll the 10, which becomes a 1. Because rerolled dice cannot be rerolled, this die remains a 1 even though it would otherwise be rerolled by the Double Boon 1. His final result is 9 + 1 = 10 plus his modifier.
* A final, rare nightmare case. Arthur is trying to make a cup of tea. This endeavor has Double Boon 1, Boon 4, Bane 7, and Double Bane 10. (This should be EXTREMELY rare.) He rolls his dice, and gets a 9 and a 1. Double Bane 10 does not affect any dice. Bane 7 causes the 9 to be rerolled, and it ends at a 4. Double Boon 1 allows him to reroll the other die, when lands on an 8. The 4 would ordinarily be rerollable with Boon 4, but that die has already been rerolled. The final result is 4 + 8 = 12 plus his modifier.
### Changing the number of dice
The most extreme and rarest effects will have you rolling one or three d10s. If you are at an EXTREME disadvantage in a task, you will only be able to roll a single die and must succeed or fail with half the usual power. If you are at a similarly significant advantage in a task, you may roll three dice, taking the results of the best two. (Just borrow one from the player next to you.) On top of all that, Bane and Boon applies normally in these circumstances.

**Boon Caster** [Augmentor]  
When you cast an Augment which provides Boon, it instead provides Double Boon. 
// This one is likely going to get cut soon.

## Stances

* **Stance** - A special class of Blessing. You may only have one Stance active at a time.

**Protector’s Stance**  
Blessing [Stance]  
Prerequisites: None  
Reserved: 2 MP  
Effect: You have Taunt.  
Special: You may only have one Stance active at a time. Changing or deactivating a stance is a minor action.  
Description: The simplest way to protect one’s allies. This can be bodily blocking blows, utilizing your shield to redirect foes away from allies, shouting to keep the attention on yourself, and other similar actions in combat.  

* **Discipline** - These Feats augment a hero’s stances, increasing their defense and offence while in a stance as well as allowing them strike while fluidly switching stances.

**Controlled Adjustment** [Discipline]  
When you change your Stance, you may choose one of the following benefits:
* You move one square.
* You regain HP or MP equal to the removed Stance’s cost.
* You use an ability whose Tier level is at most one below your Hero Tier. (Note: at Hero Tier 1, this means you may use a Tier 0 ability.) Using this option changes the action required to change your stance to match the ability used. For the purposes of the ability used, act as though both the new and old Stances are simultaneously active.

**Counterbane Stance**  
Blessing [Stance] [Strong Signature]  
Prerequisites: None  
Reserved: 5 MP  
//TODO Cost needs to scale somehow? Would need to add another effect that scales to prevent a   
//bitter taste  
Effect: You completely ignore Bane and Double Bane 10 when attacking. Otherwise, if an effect would cause you to gain Bane or Double Bane when attacking, increase the number by half your Strength, maximum 10. (Example: If you have 4 Strength, Bane 8 becomes Bane 10 for attacks while in this stance.)  
Description: A fighting stance that focuses on accuracy, allowing one to overcome distractions and hindrances.

**Defender’s Intervention**  
Blessing [Stance] [Toughness Signature]  
Prerequisites: None  
Reserved: 3, 6, 9, ... MP  
//Cost needs to scale somehow? Would need to add another effect that scales to prevent a   
//bitter taste  
Effect: When an ally is targeted with a hostile Attack or Spell within a Short range, you may immediately move to that ally’s square and take the attack instead. Once you have done this, you cannot do it again until after your next turn (unless augmented as described below).  
Special: You may only have one Stance active at a time. Changing or deactivating a stance is a minor action.  
Beginning at Hero Tier 2, you may choose to reserve more mana to gain additional uses of the Effect per round. Every Hero Tier, you may increase the reservation cost by 3 to gain one additional attack absorbed through this stance. One can only move a total of one square per turn with this ability, regardless of the number of attack redirected to you.  
Description: A very direct approach to protecting others. Typically this would mean preparing to physically run and dive in front of the defended ally.

**Aggressor's Stance**  
Blessing [Stance]  
Prerequisites: None  
Reserved: 3 MP  
Effect: Your Physical and Mental Attack increases by 1.  
Special: None  
Description: A simple but reliable boost to attack power. This can represent taking an aggressive posture in combat, reserving some energy to cast spells more efficiently, murmuring an empowering chant as one battles, mentally psyching oneself up, and similar actions.  

**Defensive Footwork** [Discipline]  
While in a stance, harmful Abilities targeting you have Bane 10. On a round where you switch stances, this becomes Double Bane 10.  
// TODO: This needs to be reworked

**Precision Strikes** [Discipline]  
If you start a battle in a Stance, increase your Offensive Track by 1.


## Momentum and Concealment (Chase scenes)
The Quarry starts with a Concealment score equal to their Hero Tier + Finesse + Mind, and the Hunter starts with a Momentum score of Hero Tier + Strength + Soul. Different starting circumstances might modify these scores--a thief caught red handed might start with a much lower Concealment score for example.  
These scores track how difficult it is for the Quarry to lose their pursuers. This will be discussed in more detail in the Lose Them action in the next section.

#### Evade
Evading is a Minor Action. When you use the Evade action, you must make a Stealth check whose difficulty is equal to 10 + your Concealment score. On success, your Concealment score increases by 1.

#### Zero In
Zeroing In is a Minor Action. When you use the Zero In, you must make an Awareness check whose difficulty is equal to 10 + your Momentum score. On success, your Momentum score increases by 1.
