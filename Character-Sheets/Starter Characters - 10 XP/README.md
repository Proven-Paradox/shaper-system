## Warrior
A straightforward and versatile physical combatant. The starter Warrior has high HP, Physical Offense, and Physical Defense. They start with low MP, but mostly use Abilities that spend HP instead of MP to compensate for this. With the Masochism Lesson, that spent HP is converted to a Shield which helps them last longer in a fight. While they are focused on doing damage in melee combat, they have the Shoot Ability for distance foes, and the Guard Ability to defend their allies, giving them a variety of combat options.
