As I work on this, it’ll eventually become the unified handbook for the system that I really need to name at some point. For now, here’s a unified list of links. NOTE: I’ve set things up so that you can comment on these pages, please feel free to do so.

## Chapter 0: Introduction
<Here I should write something about the system in general. Talk about how it’s a storytelling/roleplay system, essentially a structure around which a group of people can frame a game of pretend in various settings. Talk about how the game is flexible and modular in a way that makes it suit many different types of settings and stories. Talk about the role of the Shaper. For now just call it DM surrogate. This is not the interesting part of the rules, so I’m going to spend more effort on it closer to time to call this handbook “done.” For now, it’s more important to get to the next section.>  
> Hi. I'm Dox, the designer of this system. We're in a box right now. When we're in a box, that means I'm talking to you as the designer, and the words in the box are not necessarily part of the rules. I'll do this as an occasional aside if I need to explain something in a context other than the rules. Just keep that in mind if you see another box like this later.

## Core Tenants
These ideas are central to the design of Story Shaper. When I had a problem designing some aspect of the game, these are the guiding concepts that I came back to. Any time one designs a complex system of any sort, one will inevitably come to points where one must compromise something or cut some idea that had appeal at one point. These are the things I refused to negotiate or cut.  
* **Speed.** In several game types I’ve played, either I or other players have gotten bogged down by minutiae that caused turns to drag out. “Is that guy in line of sight?” “How close do I need to get to use this spell?” “Where do I throw this grenade such that it hits enemies without hitting allies?” “Okay, I’ve rolled my 10 damage dice, give me a minute to add this all up.” These questions might be interesting and worthwhile in certain settings, but I have never enjoyed working these things out playing on a tabletop. These measurements are not FUN--with the possible exception of adding up a big fist full of damage. Making sure this is done fairly requires a lot of time, bogging the game down and making a fight that takes less than a minute in game time take two hours in real life. Therefore, if a given task is not going to be fun for most players at the table, Story Shaper will try to make that task quick, easy, and painless. If this has gone well, then an experienced player who knows their character should never take more than two minutes to figure out the rules for his or her turn. (Of course, one may take considerably longer describing these actions.)  
* **Versatility.** One question that IS always fun in a storytelling game is “How do you want to do this?” Describing your hero or heroine’s over the top, badass maneuvers can be the purest joy of a tabletop game. However, game systems often try to do too much of that work for you. This attack only works with maces. Your fire bombs cost exactly this much to create, and do exactly this much damage within exactly this area. Casting a lightning bolt spell requires these motions and these words. If you want to make a character who imitates Indiana Jones, you want to use this class combination and make these choices. These kinds of things are restrictions do not serve the core enjoyment of a roleplaying game. A good group with an open minded referee can get past this limitation of course, but one should not need to fight the gaming system to get the kind of combat maneuvers one wants. Attacks, spells, and other maneuvers common to a heroic tale are thus kept purposefully generic to leave room for a player to describe their character’s actions as they desire. There is no reason to make casting a fireball spell any different from utilizing dragon breath or throwing a fire bomb. That should be a question of the setting and the character, not the rules.  
* **Depth**. Not all gaming systems suffer from the problems I listed above. However, many negate these problems by simplifying, going too far and leaving the system just an uninteresting way to resolve conflict. The term “RPG” stands for “role-playing game.” It’s fine to be primarily interested in role-playing, but one should also be eager to engage with the GAME part of that acronym. And the thing that makes any game engaging is making interesting decisions. Story Shaper has been constructed to create deep mechanics at every step of the game. Choosing your character’s Attributes, Abilities, and what they do in a given situation should present satisfying puzzles. One with many valid solutions that rewards smart play and mastery of the system, but NOT so many approaches to invite analysis paralysis or pitfalls that render characters impotent.

## What you Need to Play

### Required:
* A pair of 10 sided dice for each player (also called d10s).
* A single 6 sided die for the entire group
* Pencil and paper. (Do NOT use pen or something you can’t easily erase for anything. Trust me.)
### Recommended but not vital:
* Standardized character sheets that help determine character attributes (provided in this book, have a copy for each player)
* A play mat with grid sections large enough to house multiple characters or a dry erase surface to help keep track of character positions
### Totally optional, but maybe fun:
* Miniatures to represent characters in combat
* Props to illustrate circumstances on the battlefield
   * Here’s a cheap one: those plastic rings around bottled drinks can be removed and used as markers
* A deck of playing cards or tarot cards (just in case a card game breaks out)
* A notebook for each player to write personal notes in
***
# Chapter 1: How to Play
<Like the intro, this isn’t the interesting part. Start by talking about character creation, refer to more in depth rules later. For moment to moment play, talk about Shaper describing the world, taking control of other characters, players describing their actions, Shaper describing results.>  
## Rolling Dice
One of the most important things separating a roleplaying game from simple pretend is the addition of rules. In a game with no rules, it can be difficult to make something bad happen to another character. And a story where nothing bad happens to the heroes has no sense of adversity. Maybe that doesn’t bother you, in which case feel free to get with friends and have a great time just playing pretend with each other, societal norms be damned. But if you want to participate in a story where the stakes are high, danger is everywhere, and you don’t know what will happen to your character, you need rules to make things unpredictable. How does one add unpredictability? There are many methods, but in this game you roll dice.

In general when you are asked to roll dice in Story Shaper, you will roll a pair of ten sided dice. This gets you a range of 2 to 20, with results in the middle being significantly more likely than extreme results. You will then take the two dice, add the results together, and add a modifier to that which is based on your character’s attributes (more on that later). The higher the result, the better you did at the task in question.
## Rerolls
Some circumstances enable a player to reroll their dice. As a general rule, a given die can only be rerolled once, even if the new roll would otherwise qualify to be rerolled.
### Boon
Circumstances or character traits sometimes grant a character an advantage that allows them to get favorable dice results in ways other than increasing their modifier. This is principally done by granting Boon X. When a roll is made with Boon +X, the player may reroll one die if it is equal to or less than X. You must take the new roll, even if it is lower. Some examples of Boon in play:
* Varna makes a Stealth roll with Boon +3. He rolls his two d10s and gets a 2 and a 6. He chooses to reroll the 2, getting an 8, giving a final result of 6 + 8 = 14, plus his modifier.
* Jonny aims a gun and takes a shot that has Boon +2. He rolls his two d10s and gets a 1 and a 2. He can only reroll one die with Boon, so he chooses to reroll the 1 and gets a 4. His final result of 2 + 4 = 6, plus any modifiers.
* Marona is trying to haggle at a shop with Boon +4. She rolls a 4 and a 9. She is allowed to keep this roll if she likes, but chooses to use the reroll and gets a 1. Her final result is 9 + 1 = 10 plus her modifier.
### Bane
The unfavorable complement of Boon, Bane is sometimes imposed on a character when circumstances or sabotage make the character more likely to fail at a task. When a roll is made with Bane -X, the player must reroll their highest die if it is equal to or greater than (11 - X). 

| Bane -X | Reroll a die above... |
|---------|-----------------------|
| -1      | 10                    |
| -2      | 9                     |
| -3      | 8                     |
| -4      | 7                     |
| -5      | 6                     |

Some examples of Bane in play:
* Adam is trying to follow tracks that have had some time to fade, imposing Bane -3, meaning he must reroll any results over 8 (11 - 3). He rolls a 9 and a 1. Bane forces him to reroll the 9, which comes up as a 2. Final result is 1 + 2 = 3.
* XU-808 has Bane -4 on an attempt to repair a damaged mechanism. He must reroll any result above a 7. He rolls a 7 and a 10. Because Bane specifies that one must reroll the higher die, the 10 is rerolled to a 3, for a final result of 7 + 3 = 10 plus any modifiers.
### Combining Boon and Bane
If in a situation where boon Boon and Bane apply, they cancel each other out. Add their values and reroll based on the result. Some examples:
* Erin is attacking while affected by a blessing that gives her Boon +2, but is attacking an opponent who has a defensive spell that imposes Bane -1. Boon +2 and Bane -1 adds up to Boon +1, meaning she rerolls a die if she rolls a 1.
* Morris is attempting to pick a lock. His skill in lock picking gives him Boon +1 on the check, but his picks have been damaged in a way that provides Bane -3. Boon +1 and Bane -3 adds to Bane -2, meaning he must reroll a die if the roll is higher than 9.
* Arden is trying to leap over to a ledge. They have an item that grants them minor athletic ability with Boon +2, but a windstorm is making it harder with Bane -2. Boon +2 and Bane -2 adds to 0, so they will not have any opportunity or obligation to reroll dice.

### Let's get this over with: Some general rules  
Here are a few of the more fiddly rules that we need to get out of the way, just so there is no confusion.  

You count as your own ally. You can target yourself with anything that is listed to target allies.

Round down. If you ever have a fraction, just cut off the fractional bit entirely. Even if your result is (somehow?) 13.9, it should still be rounded down to a 13.  

In combat, defenders win ties. For example, if using an attack Ability results in the accuracy role matching the defender’s Defense, the attack misses and the defender suffers no consequence.  
For a tie during opposed skill checks (such as Empathy versus Deception, or Awareness versus Stealth), both characters reroll until there is no tie. Any Boon or Bane on the rolls still apply when rerolling due to a tie.  

If a damage type is not listed, assume the damage to be physical.

# Chapter 2: Character Creation
Before you can begin playing a game of Story Shaper, you have to know who (or what) the persona you’re taking control of actually is, what they can do, and what they struggle with. You should also flesh that character out, make them a person, a someone who belongs in an epic tale (or perhaps an UN-epic tale, depending on the sort of game you’re trying to play). In this section, we will go through the steps of building characters. The focus will be on how the character is represented in rules. This is because the act of fleshing out a character in the context of how that person fits into the world, what the character looks like, the characters motivations and fears, all of these should be an exercise mostly taken between the Shaper and the player.
## Step 1: Attributes
Each character’s general characteristics are represented by their “Attributes.” These are numbers that broadly represent the character’s capabilities. These add directly to at least two other secondary statistics and are added in when making certain skill checks (more on both of these subjects later).  
A zero represents average human performance in that Attribute, and from there it can go positive or negative. Two or above represents a gifted individual, and above five indicates superhuman ability. Negative two or below indicates an impairment that has a significant effect on one’s life, and negative five and below represents difficulty so severe that one cannot get by day to day without assistance.  
Your Shaper will tell you the rules on how you determine your Attributes. My recommendation is to give between five and seven points to spend, with the option to take a -1 in order to increase another attribute by 1. I recommend against randomizing Attribute generation, but I can’t stop a Shaper who disagrees.

There are six attributes: Strength, Finesse, Toughness, Mind, Heart, and Soul. 
* **Strength** represents both raw strength and one’s ability to utilize strength. High strength may mean people ask your character to help move things for them a lot, or perhaps that they are on some kind of athletics team. They could be visibly muscular. Meanwhile, low strength might result in the character being spindly or out of shape.
   * Strength is also added to your Hit Points and Physical Attack stats.
* **Finesse** represents how agile or dextrous your character is. High finesse means that you would generally move with grace, or perhaps represents good aim or dexterity. Low finesse might instead confer general clumsiness.
   * Finesse is also added to your Initiative, Physical Attack, and Physical Defense stats.
* **Toughness** represents health and hardiness. A character with high toughness may never seem to tire from physical activity or shrug off injuries with relative ease, while low toughness might mean the character is sickly or bruises easily.
   * Toughness is also added to your Hit Points and Physical Defense stats.
* **Mind** represents intelligence and cleverness. A character with high mind generally has a good memory, makes good grades if they put in the effort to do so, and is a great problem solver. Low mind often means difficulty learning new technical concepts and a hard time remembering some details.
   * Mind is also added to your Mental Points and Mental Attack stats.
* **Heart** represents charisma and presence. Someone with high heart is able to naturally be the center of attention or get people to do what they want, while someone with low heart might naturally go unnoticed in social situations or just generally lack presence.
   * Heart is also added to your Mental Points and Mental Defense stats.
* **Soul** represents centeredness and perception. Someone with high soul might not be religious but is likely very spiritual while also being good at reading people or noticing small details. Meanwhile someone with low soul would generally have a difficult time with spiritual pursuits such as meditation and also have a general obliviousness to them.
   * Soul is also added to your Mental Attack and Mental Defense stats.
   
If you’re struggling to come up with your Attribute arrangement, here are a few recommendations that can help.

* Be careful about overspecialization. Most characters want to be particularly good at doing one thing, but if you leave your character unable to do anything else at all you may end up unable to contribute in some situations. For example, a hero who has a very high HP pool along with high Defense attributes is good, but if said hero has no means of dealing damage or drawing a foe’s attention, the enemy may just ignore the character. A character with tremendous MP and Mental Attack may do a lot of damage, but if said character’s HP and Physical Defense is low then they may not last long enough to utilize said MP. You can’t be good at everything, but try to be decent at a few things. If you do choose to completely specialize in one approach, you should consider choosing Abilities that will let you overcome your weaknesses (more on that later).
* If you have stats to spare and you’re not sure where they should go, consider investing them in Toughness. More HP and Defense is always a benefit.

## Step 2-a: Capacity Stats
After choosing your class and your Attributes, you can determine your capacity stats. One could also call these points.
* **Max HP:** HP stands for hit points or health points (both work), and they are an abstract representation of a character’s health. While the character still has HP, they can still press on. At first level you gain fifteen plus your Strength times three plus your Toughness times three HP. [15 + (STR*3) + (TGH*3)] (See Chapter X for a more thorough description of what HP represent.)
* **Max MP:** MP stats for mental points or mana points. Hopefully you recognize a pattern here. While some Abilities spend HP, most require you to spend MP to use them. You start with fifteen plus your Mind times three plus your Heart times three. [15 + (MND*3) + (HRT*3)]
* **SP:** SP stands for skill points. This will be elaborated upon further when we discuss skills, but for now the higher this number is, the more things you’ll be able to do outside of combat. You start with 15 skill points.

## Step 2-b: Attack/Defense
These are modifiers to your attacks’ accuracy or your ability to avoid a foes’ attacks. It is relatively rare for a roll to be modified only by one’s Attributes; rolls generally have two Attributes added as well as some modifiers from XP bonuses. The secondary stats are as follows.
* **Physical Attack:** This broadly represents your ability to effectively attack foes by mundane means. The better your physical attack, the more likely you are to successfully hit foes and do more damage with fists, melee weapons, and non-mental missile attacks. A high physical attack could imply great strength, well honed training, precise aim, and other such characteristics. You add your Strength and Finesse to physical attack.
* **Mental Attack:** This broadly represents your ability to manipulate energy, technology, or other non-physical forces to strike out at foes. High mental attack could imply an intense well of inner power to draw upon, better understanding of technology used to inflict harm on others, a connection to some external power source you channel to lash out at your enemies, or something similar. The term “mental” is here mainly to differentiate it from “physical” and could easily be adjusted to apply to technology, magic, psychic powers, natural weapons, or other such means power sources. You add your Mind and Soul to mental attack.
* **Physical Defense:** This statistic represents your ability to mitigate mundane strikes sent against you. This could imply being quick enough to dodge attacks, tough enough to just ignore them, being equipped with armor or shields to protect you, or a combination of these effects. You start with 10 Physical Defense. You add your Toughness and Finesse to physical defense.
* **Mental Defense:** Do you see the pattern yet? Mental defense enables you to mitigate damage you would otherwise take from energy attacks. High mental defense can imply being trained in counterspells or arcane shielding techniques, understanding and utilizing equipment or technology that dampens or redirects energy directed at you, or just being so resilient that you can endure the attack without harm. You start with 10 Mental Defense. You add your Heart and Soul to mental defense.
* **Initiative:** A bit of an odd one out. At the beginning of a dangerous encounter (usually but not always combat) you make an initiative roll. This determines the order in which characters act. You add your Finesse to initiative rolls.

How one uses these attributes will be described in Chapter 10.

## Step 3: Abilities
The next step is to choose Abilities. Chapter 4 goes into greater detail on what an Ability actually entails. In short, an Ability represents a maneuver that characters can utilize in combat. These will define your role when you’re fighting. When a character is created, they know three Abilities (two + one gained from being level 1) for free as well as all Tier 0 Abilities.


Some advice if you want to make a powerful character and are having trouble choosing your Abilities:
* If you don’t have a better plan, you should have at least one Ability that fits within your character’s intended skill set. Your Strength dominant hero should have at least one melee attack. A Mind/Heart dominant hero is going to want mental attacks.
* That said, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If all of your attacks are melee range then an enemy who attacks from a distance will be a severe problem for you. If you have nothing but healing or support Abilities, then you will be helpless if you get separated from your allies. Once you have your core covered you might add some variety to your arsenal.
* At first level your HP and MP pool will be limited. Keep costs in mind when picking Abilities. If an Ability requires too much of your MP to use once, maybe it’s not a good choice.
* After the first level, you will have more resources to spend. In that case it is wise to choose at least one Ability that requires a Minor Action to use. Doing so allows you to increase your effectiveness by letting you more consistently use both of your Actions. (More on Actions in chapter 10)

## Step 4: Skills
Finally, you will distribute skill points. There’s more information on skills in Chapter 6, but the general idea is that skills are things that your character is generally good at aside from combat. Each skill has two Attributes added to their modifier, and you can use skill points to increase that modifier. Each skill can have skill points equal to your level + 3 allocated. (So if you’re making a first level character, you can spend at most 4 points per skill.) Skills will most often be utilized outside of combat (though certain enemies or Abilities may bring some to play during combat). You start with 15 skill points at character creation.


Here are some things to consider when distributing skill points:
* Skills are the portion of character creation most closely tied to roleplaying. Other aspects of the system have been intentionally divorced from having an impact on roleplay, but you should choose skills that make sense for your character to have.
* If you’re satisfied with your character’s representation but still have skill points remaining, consider coordinating with the other players. A given party would typically benefit from having all of their bases covered.
* If you’ve done the above and still have skill points, then consider increasing Athletics, Acrobatics, Awareness, Composure, Empathy, or Endure. These skills are either universally useful, reactive in nature, or may benefit the party to have multiple members able to use them well.

# Chapter 3: Improving your character
Rather than progressing in a class or explicitly gaining levels, heroes become stronger by spending experience points (XP) on improving their status. This will allow you to choose between a highly specialized character with a small number of very effective abilities, or a character that has many different tools, making them more likely to have exactly what is needed for a given situation.
## Gaining XP
This section will focus on how the party gains XP, and is mostly of concern to Shapers. <COME BACK TO THIS LATER>
## Spending XP
Between sessions, you can allocate your XP to buy from the benefits listed in this section. Keep up with what XP was spent in what way on your character sheet.
### Level
While there are no set classes, heroes do gain levels. Their level acts as a cap on certain values; multiple benefits that one can spend XP on can only go up to the hero’s level. Increasing a character’s level represents a general increase in competence and potential. A character’s level limits the following:
* Every level increases the number of times Vitality and Capacity can be purchased
* The hero’s base Physical Attack, Physical Defense, Mental Attack, and Mental Defense can be increased a number of times up to the character’s level
* Every five levels after the first (6, 11, 16, …) increases your hero’s Hero Tier.  

In addition, purchasing a level gives its own benefit that goes in a five level loop. These benefits do not cost additional XP.
* At levels 1, 6, 11, … the character gains an Ability of any tier they could normally learn. 
* At levels 2, 7, 12, … the character gains one level in Vitality or Capacity.
* At levels 3, 8, 13, … the character increases their Physical or Mental Defense.
* At level 4, 9, 14, … the character increases their Physical or Mental Attack.
* At level 5, 10, 15, … the character increases any one of their Attributes by 1 and gains a Capstone Power (more on Capstone Powers in Chapter 8).

When leveling up can have one of two benefits, the benefit must be applied to the lower option. For example, if a character which has one point in Vitality and no points in Capacity purchases level 2, they gain a point in Capacity. If a character’s base Physical Attack (i.e. before Attributes and other modifiers are added) is 0 while their base Mental Attack is 3, and the character purchases level 4, then their base Physical Attack improves by one. If there is a tie, the player chooses which improvement they gain.


Characters start at level 1 (and therefore gain one free ability in addition to the two they start with). Level 2 costs 5 XP, and each subsequent level costs (4 + their current level) XP. So level 3 costs 6 XP, level 4 costs 7 XP, and so on.


Sidenote \<Milestone Levels>: Instead of allowing players to purchase levels, the Shaper may instead choose to declare that all characters level up at certain milestones. While this does constrain players, it also ensures a given party will have fairly similar power levels, making it easier to balance combat encounters while also making milestones feel more impactful.
### Vitality/Capacity
Purchasing Vitality increases your hero’s maximum HP by 5 + their Strength + their Toughness. Purchasing Capacity increases your hero’s maximum MP by 5 + their Mind + their Heart. Both of these can be purchased multiple times, up to your character’s Level. Vitality and Capacity upgrades cost 3 XP.
### Physical/Mental Attack/Defense
Every character has a base bonus to their physical and mental attacks and defences. It starts at zero, but each category can be increased up to the hero’s level. Increasing Physical or Mental Attack costs 4 XP, and increasing Physical or Mental Defense costs 3 XP.
### Skill Points
You may spend 2 XP to gain 5 skill points. Keep in mind that the maximum number of points you can put into any skill is 3 + your level.
### Abilities
Abilities represent things you can actively do, typically in combat. These can come from training in elaborate techniques, learning spells, building equipment, natural biology, or whatever justification is suitable for a given hero being able to do something.

Abilities come in four tiers. You may only purchase Abilities from tiers less than or equal to your Hero Tier. They cost 1 + (2 * their tier) XP. So 3 for tier 1, 5 for tier 2, 7 for tier 3, and 9 for tier 4.

Abilities are described in more detail in Chapter 4 and listed individually in Chapter 5.
### Powers
Powers represent passive abilities. These generally modify rolls, giving benefits when certain conditions are met. They offer notable benefits when using certain types of Abilities or grant a benefit in some conditions. Powers cost 5 XP unless an exception is listed.

Powers are described in more detail in Chapter 7.
### Capstone Powers
Capstone Powers represent significantly more impactful modifications to your character’s abilities. They either apply more broadly or have much higher influence than standard Powers, and as such they are only available when you reach a level divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15…). They have no cost to purchase.

Capstone Powers are described in more detail in Chapter 7.
### Utilities
Utilities represent non-combat abilities that aid an adventurer. These may influence Skill rolls, or grant new options for a given hero. There is no limit on the number of Utilities a given character may purchase, and the XP cost for each Utility is listed in its entry.


Utilities are described in more detail in Chapter 9.
***
# Chapter 4: Abilities
Abilities represent powers or moves your character is able to do, usually in combat. When you first create a character, you choose three Abilities. Additional abilities are purchased for XP. Abilities come in four tiers, with each tier being more powerful (but more costly) than the previous. You may only purchase abilities whose tiers are equal to or lower than your Hero Tier.
## Reading Abilities
Ability entries will follow this basic layout (and further information about each aspect will be expanded upon after the summary): //Image would be fantastic here.

**The Name of the Ability**

Action (Major/Minor/Counter): whether the Ability requires a Minor, Major, or Counter Action to use. (Actions will be described in more detail in Chapter 10.)  
Prerequisites: What other things are required before one can learn this Ability.  
Range: How far away a target can be while still being in reach of this Ability. There are five possible ranges:  
* None - this skill targets yourself.
* Melee - this skill can only be used on targets in the same zone as you.
* Short - this skill can be used on targets up to one zone away.
* Medium - this skill targets enemies up to two zones away.
* Long - this skill targets enemies up to three zones away.  

Targets: Who or what this Ability targets.  
Cost: The HP or MP cost of this Ability.  
Damage: When using this Ability to do damage, multiply your Impact by this number to determine the amount.  
Special: Things particular to a given Ability.
## Prerequisites
Sometimes an Ability has a prerequisite listed in its entry. This means that you must fulfill the listed conditions before you are allowed to take that Ability. Generally this will be another Ability, often representing related skills building off of each other. There are other things that could be prerequisites, such as Attributes, as well. If at any time you no longer fulfill the prerequisites for a given Ability, you can no longer use it.
## Ability Types
There are four types of Abilities.
* **Attack** means that the Ability uses Physical Accuracy and is resisted by Physical Defense.
* **Spell** means that the Ability uses Mental Accuracy and is resisted by Mental Defense. 
   * Note that just because the term used here is “spell” the Ability does not have to represent magical actions. The effect could be produced by technology, alchemy, bizzare anatomy, or some other thing.
* **Auxiliary** Abilities do not use attack rolls. They generally target yourself or your allies.
* **Blessing** Abilities are toggled on or off (taking the listed action to switch between them), and reserve some amount of HP or MP. In exchange for reducing your maximum HP or MP in this way, you gain a benefit that is available at the start of every battle.
   * Reserved HP and MP is not available to the character; it acts as though the character’s maximum HP or MP has been reduced by that much. Unless otherwise stated, reserved HP or MP is not restored when the reserving effect is removed, but if you have missing HP or MP you reserve that before available HP and MP. 
## Ability Series
Some Abilities are part of a series, building off each other and using each other as prerequisites. A quick explanation of each follows:
* **Augment** - Auxiliary abilities that empower allies, often allowing for a larger MP cost to increase the effect.
* **Counter** - Auxiliary abilities that set up a chance for you to deal damage to foes that strike at you.
* **Curse** - Auxiliary abilities that weaken foes.
* **Elemental** - Abilities which deal damage through one of the elements:
   * *Fire* - heat and flames
   * *Ice* - sharp icicles and freezing cold
   * *Earth* - shards of rock, acid, and plant vines
   * *Sky* - electricity, wind blades, and the like
   * *Light* - radiance, blinding light, and holy power
   * *Dark* - Destroying life essence, sharpened shadows, or unholy power
* **Healing** - Abilities that focus on restoring and rejuvenating allies. This can be by magically mending wounds, quickly bandaging cuts, singing a song that restores their spirits, or recharging their shields.
* **Kinetic** - Abilities which deal damage through force applied at a distance. This can be telekinetically hurling objects, firing bolts of concentrated force, or the like.
* **Powerful** - Abilities which focus on doing heavy physical damage in melee to one or multiple opponents. This is generally accomplished through muscle, but they can be the result of powered armor or great skill.
* **Ranged** - Abilities which focus on doing accurate physical attacks from a distance. These can be longbows, crossbows, sniper rifles, throwing knives, launched quills, or any other projectile you like.
* **Scan** - Abilities that focus on finding information about enemies, often in covert ways, and gaining advantages from that knowledge.
* **Terrain** - Abilities that change the battlefield, generally to limit what enemies are able to do. Note that Terrain abilities are not normally able to be dispelled after casting and may hinder allies as much as they hinder enemies.
* **Skilled** - Abilities which focus on movement or striking multiple times. This can be self-taught street fighting or the result of years of training in a monastery, and anything in between.

## Ability Keywords
Some specific terms come with Abilities. These can be effects that Abilities confer on you, or things that change how you use the Abilities themselves. Here are their definitions:
* **Careful** - An Ability that normally only uses the listed Major or Minor Action, but that is improved if you also use your second Action on it, representing taking the time to do it right.
* **Cover** - If you have Cover and you are in a space with any other ally, enemies cannot target you. Any Abilities that pick a target can only pick your other allies. Abilities that affect squares instead of targets can still affect you as normal.
* **Grounded** - An Terrain Ability with the [Grounded] tag must be cast with a floor beneath it. These Abilities cannot be cast at airborne squares, and do not affect characters with the [Hover](#hover) Power or [Flight](#flight) Condition.
* **Overload** - An Ability that can be improved if you add an additional cost. This represents putting more of your energy or power into the Ability.
* **Taunt** - If you have Taunt and are in a space with any other ally, enemies must target you. Any Abilities that pick a target can only pick you. Abilities that affect squares instead of targets can still affect your allies as normal.
* **Upkeep** - Any ability with an Upkeep in its cost requires the given cost to be paid at the beginning of the user's turn. As long as its Upkeep is paid, the Ability has no duration. (To clarify; the listed cost is paid when the action starting it is taken, and the Upkeep cost is paid on all subsequent rounds.)

The Buff/Debuff tracks are a way of measuring advantage or disadvantage Offense or Defense. Unless you are in conditions that specify otherwise, you start every combat at level 0 in both tracks. Several different Abilities can affect this track, which provides appropriate benefits or downsides to every character in a unified way.
### The Offensive Track
* **Level 3** - You make attack rolls at Boon 4.
* **Level 2** - You make attack rolls at Boon 3, and your Abilities that require Attack rolls cost 1 less HP or MP per Hero Tier. This cannot take an Ability’s cost below 1.
* **Level 1** - You make attack rolls at Boon 2.
* **Level 0** - Normal, no changes.
* **Level -1** - You make attack rolls at Bane 9.
* **Level -2** - You make attack rolls at Bane 8, and your Abilities that require Attack rolls cost 1 more HP or MP per Hero Tier. 
* **Level -3** - You make attack rolls at Bane 7.
### The Defensive Track
* **Level 3** - Attack rolls made against you have Bane 7.
* **Level 2** - Attack rolls made against you have Bane 8, and your Mental and Physical Defense increases by your Hero Tier.
* **Level 1** - Attack rolls made against you have Bane 9.
* **Level 0** - Normal, no changes.
* **Level -1** - Attack rolls against you have Boon 2.
* **Level -2** - Attack rolls against you have Boon 3, and your Mental and Physical Defense decreases by your Hero Tier.
* **Level -3** - Attack rolls against you have Boon 4.
### The Regen/Degen Track
Unlike the previous tracks described, the regen/degen track has no limit. If you begin your turn with a positive value on this track, your HP regenerates by that amount, and if you begin your turn with a negative value, your HP degenerates by that amount. After this HP gain or loss, you move one position towards 0. So for example, if Roland is at 3 on the track, he regains 3 HP and his position then becomes 2. Unless something further happens to change his position, the next turn he would recover 2 HP and move to 1 on the track.  
Positive values can represent gradual magical healing, an injection of tissue repairing nanobots, or similar ways to heal over time. Negative values could represent venom, bleeding, being drained of energy, or similar sources of gradual damage.

The Cover produced this way lasts until the beginning of your next turn, but requires you be in the same space as the targetted ally.

________________
# Chapter 6: Skills
Skills represent what your character is good at more broadly than Abilities. Skills are general purpose things and are usually rolled outside of combat, though Skills may come up in combat at times.  

Your maximum number of Skill Points that can be invested into any one Skill is equal to your Character Level + 3.  
Skill checks should only occur when there is some sort of pressure or danger present in a situation, or if the action being attempted is of non-trivial difficulty. For example, the Arbiter generally should not call for a Skill check to climb a ladder unless the character doing it is rushed, being attacked, or under similar duress. If that same character were trying to climb a sheer cliff face, an Athletics check is necessary.  
Skills can also be used to answer questions about a related subject. For example, if you needed to know how much weight a pillar can bear, you can make a Construct check. To identify a song being played by someone else, roll a Performance check. To know the correct greeting in a formal situation in an unfamiliar land, make a Diplomacy check. To estimate the value of a pocketwatch or a cut jewel you’ve found, make a Craft check.  
Each skill has two associated Attributes. All skills of that type add those two Attributes in addition to any skill points that have been spent in those skills.  

## Helping Others
In situations where others need help with a skill you are well trained in, you can make the roll in their place. When you do this, you roll with half of your modifier. The character you are helping then treats that result as their own. Note that it is not always possible to help others with their checks.

## Skill List
#### Acrobatics  
Attributes: Strength, Finesse  
Balancing, tumbling, contorting. Tasks that require precise movements as well as power.

#### Deception  
Attributes: Mind, Heart  
Lying, disguise, conning. This skill is called for any time you wish to mask the truth.  
Alternatively, this skill can be used as a player aid. If a player happens to be less skilled at deception than the character they are playing would be, the Arbiter may allow the player to roll a deception check to get a suggestion for what to say in a given situation.

#### Diplomacy  
Attributes: Heart, Soul  
Negotiation, decorum, sociability. This skill is used when a player wants to make a good impression in a social situation.  
Alternatively, this skill can be used as a player aid. If a player happens to be less silver tongued than the character they are playing would be, the Arbiter may allow the player to roll a diplomacy check to get a suggestion for what to say in a given situation.

#### Drive (TYPE)  
Attributes: Finesse, Mind  
Handling vehicles or mounts. Options include a mount, a car, a ship, a plane, or anything similar. 

#### Empathy  
Attributes: Heart, Soul

#### Endure  
Attributes: Toughness, Heart  
Pain tolerance, doing without, pressing on. This is a reactive skill: if a player is subject to forces that would impair their functioning, they can shrug it off with a successful Endure check.

#### Intimidation  
Attributes: Strength, Heart  
Browbeating and bullying. When the player wants something and is willing to threaten others to get it, this is the skill to use.

#### Investigation  
Attributes: Mind, Soul

#### Lore  
Attributes: Mind, Soul  
Forbidden secrets, occult rituals, and mysticism. This skill represents one’s exposure to obscure, often taboo knowledge.

#### Medicine  
Attributes: Mind, Finesse  
Anatomical knowledge, herbalism, and performing medical procedures. If you need to suture a wound, identify a poison, diagnose a disease, and other such actions, you should make a Medicine check.

#### Performance  
Attributes: Finesse, Heart  
Singing, dancing, storytelling. This skill is used to gauge how entertained a crowd is with a show.

Operating all sorts of computers, general technical savviness, hacking, and the like.

# Chapter 7: Powers
Broadly speaking, Powers represent passive combat benefits or extra options available to someone trained in specific style of combat. Some powers will list prerequisites; if that is the case then you must meet these prerequisites to be able to take the Power, and if you ever fail to meet those prerequisites you gain no benefit from the associated Power.  
Powers cost 5 XP unless an exception is listed.

#### A Curse Most Foul  
When using a Curse ability, you may choose one of the following benefits.
* Decrease the Bane applied by the curse by 1 (making it more debilitating). Bane 10 becomes Bane 9, Bane 9 becomes Bane 8, and so on.
* If the Curse costs HP, you may spend MP instead. If it costs MP, you may spend HP instead.
* If the curse decreases a victim on the buff/debuff track, the victim of your Curse also takes damage equal to your Soul. The damage increases by an amount equal to your Soul every time you increase in Hero Tier (so Soul x 2 at Hero Tier 2, Soul x 3 at Hero Tier 3, and so on).

#### Advantageous Recovery  
When you strike a foe’s elemental weakness, you regain HP and MP equal to your Mind, up to a maximum equal to the HP or MP used to perform the striking Ability. This benefit increases as you raise your Hero Tier: the recovery increases by an amount equal to your Mind (so Mind x 2 at Hero Tier 2, Mind x 3 at Hero Tier 3, and so on). This Power can only be activated once per Ability use; striking multiple foes with one Ability cannot restore HP or MP more than once.

#### Anger  
Whenever you receive damage you may enter an Enraged state. Spending HP to use an Ability or any effect described as “lose life” (such as losing HP due to low Endurance during a chase) does not count as damage. Damage from any source can activate Anger. While Enraged, your Physical and Mental Attack increases by 2, but your Physical and Mental Defense decreases by 3. Every time you increase in Hero Tier, the Attack bonus and Defense penalty both increase by 1. If you end your turn without having received damage since the end of your previous turn, you are no longer Enraged.

#### Ataraxia  
If you have not moved between the beginning of your previous turn and your current turn, you may reduce the MP cost of any Spells you cast by your Hero Tier (to a minimum of 0).

#### Bloodlust  
When you successfully kill or knock out a foe, your next attack is made at Boon 6.

#### Curse Resistant  
The first time you would have one of your buff/debuff tracks reduced each battle, ignore the effect. For the purposes of this Lesson, a period of 30 minutes or longer without being in mortal peril is considered a separate combat.  

#### Dash  
When you move as a Major action, you can choose to move two squares instead of one.

#### Deadened Nerves  
Reduce all damage you take (after multipliers are applied) by your half your Toughness (minimum damage reduction: 1). This benefit increases as you raise your Hero Tier: the damage reduction increases by an amount equal to your half your Toughness each Hero Tier (so Toughness x 1 at Hero Tier 2, Toughness x 1.5 at Hero Tier 3, and so on).  
//Need to monitor this. Don’t want it to be strictly stronger than Enduring Protector.  
//If this isn’t doing enough, maybe I need to increase both this and Enduring Protector benefits?

#### Defensive Lock  
When being attacked by a foe that you have Locked On to, you gain a bonus to your Physical/Mental Defense equal to your Hero Tier. This increases the Upkeep of Lock On by 1.

#### Double Ward  
When you use [Ward](#ward), you may choose to increase the cost to 3. If you do, you may choose a second element. The applied ward protects against both kind of damage. The ward is still expended after protecting against a single Ability. This counts as paying an Overload cost.

#### Enduring Protector  
After taking damage in place of an ally--for example, when using an ability such as Defender’s Intervention--or are targeted by a single target offensive ability while you have Taunt and are in the same space as another ally, you gain Shield equal to your Toughness. This benefit increases as you raise your Hero Tier: the shield increases by an amount equal to your Toughness each Hero Tier (so Toughness x 2 at Hero Tier 2, Toughness x 3 at Hero Tier 3, and so on). This shield lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You may only gain this shield once per round.  
//See comments on Deadened Nerves

#### Elemental Attunement  
When you gain this power, pick one of the following: Fire, Cold, Sky, Earth, Light, or Dark. Whenever you use an Ability with the [Elemental] tag, you may chose to deal damage of the corresponding type.  
Special: You may take this Power more than once, choosing a different element each time. The first time you gain an Ability with the [Elemental] tag, you also automatically gain Elemental Attunement for free once.  
Every additional instance of this Power costs 3 XP.

#### Extended Duration Obstacles  
Increase the duration of any Terrain Abilities you use by a number of rounds equal to your Hero Tier. In addition, you can dismiss your own Terrain Abilities as a Minor action.  
// Need to keep an eye on scaling here

#### First to Act  
Increase your Initiative modifier by your Hero Tier. Also, you gain Boon 2 on Initiative rolls.

#### Fortifying Voice  
When you target creatures with an Augment, all affected gain Shield equal to your Mental Defense - 10.

#### Healing Rush  
After you successfully heal an ally, choose one of the following effects. These effects last until the beginning of your next turn.
* Increase the target’s Physical or Mental Attack by your Hero Tier.
* Increase the target’s Physical and Mental Defense by your Hero Tier.
* The target can move an extra square when making default movements. (This does not affect Abilities that involve movement.)

#### Hit and Run  
When you use a melee range Attack, you can move one square as part of the Attack. You can do this before or after making the Attack.

#### Improved Healing  
When casting a Healing Ability, you may roll an additional ten-sided die. Remove the lowest die from your total result.

#### Long Arm of Justice  
Increase the range at which you Counter Abilities can affect enemies by 1. For example, the Riposte Ability normally only reaches enemies who make Melee range attacks. With this Lesson, Riposte would also function against enemies who strike from Short range. (This could be reflecting missiles, expanding your retaliation field, invoking stronger magical counters, or something similar.)

#### Mana from Momentum  
After you cast a spell, the next spell you cast on your turn has its HP or MP cost reduced by your Hero Tier, to a minimum of 0.
//TODO Consider if this is powerful enough

#### Masochism  
Any time you spend HP to use an Attack or Spell, you gain Shield equal to the spent health that lasts until your next turn. If you successfully hit with an ability that costs HP, you deal that HP cost as extra damage (after the Multiplier is applied).

#### Offensive Lock  
When attacking a foe that you have Locked On to, you gain a bonus to your Physical/Mental Defense equal to your Hero Tier. This increases the Upkeep of Lock On by 1.

#### Overcharge  
If your healing would bring your target above maximum HP, the target gains Shield to the excess. Targets can only have one Shield from this Power; if a larger Shield would be applied by this Power, the smaller one fades immediately. The Shield also fades at the start of your next turn.

#### Pickup  
When you heal an ally from 0 HP, add twice your Heart to the healing done. This benefit increases as you raise your Hero Tier: the additional healing increases by an amount equal to your twice your Heart each Hero Tier (so Heart x 4 at Hero Tier 2, Heart x 6 at Hero Tier 3, and so on).

#### Pursuit Lock  
Once per round, when an opponent you have Locked On to moves, you may choose to follow them. This is only possible if the Locked On foe is within Short distance.

#### Quick Healer  
Increase any HP restoration you receive by half.  
> Remember that all fractions round down. Also to be clear; this affects the Regeneration track as well.

#### Reaching Terrain
Terrain effects with the [Grounded] tag that you create affect creatures with the [Hover](#hover) Power or [Flight](#flight) Condition as though the Ability were not [Grounded]. A character with this Power may cast [Grounded] Abilities in the air as well as on the ground.

#### Relentless  
When you successfully strike with an ability that forces a target to move, you gain the following benefits.  
* You may automatically move toward the target as many spaces as you forced them to move. If you forced multiple targets to move, choose one to follow.
* Your target cannot move until your next turn.
//TODO: Look at the cannot move condition

#### Resilient Protector  
When you take a would blow in place of an ally--such when using an ability such as Defender’s Intervention--or are targeted by a single target offensive Ability while you have Taunt and are in the same space as another ally, increase your Physical and Mental Defense by your Hero Tier for that attack.

#### Sadism  
When you kill or knock out a foe, increase your Offensive Track by 1.

#### Siege Caster  
If you have not moved between the beginning of your previous turn and your current turn, your Physical and Mental Attack increases by an amount equal to your Hero Tier.

#### Spell Sniper  
If you have not moved between the beginning of your previous turn and your current turn, the range of any spell you cast increases by one square.

#### Superior Scanner  
When you use a Scan Ability, choose one of the following benefits.
* You scan all targets in one square
* You learn the target’s Physical and Mental Attack in addition to the usual stats.
* You gain Boon 4 on the Stealth or Deception roll to conceal your use of the Scan ability from your target.
* You Lock On to the target. Lock On applied in this way has Upkeep 0.

#### Thick Skin  
You gain an additional 2 HP per Vitality. This Lesson applies retroactively.

#### Walk it Off  
Ignore the first Injury you would receive every combat. For the purposes of this Lesson, a period of 30 minutes or longer without being in mortal peril is considered a separate combat.  
//TODO Not 100% satisfied with the language of this one. Conveys meaning, but I want to refine. Consider "per scene"

#### Wardsense  
You are able to sense and identify wards placed by enemies accurately.  
Special: This Power costs 3 XP.

#### Wide Ward  
When you use a single target Ward that normally has a Minor action requirement, you may increase that to a Major action. If you do, the Ward affects one square. Applying this Technique counts as using a Careful action, even on Abilities that normally do not have the [Careful] tag.

*** 
# Chapter 8: Capstone Powers
A character gains a Capstone Powers for free when gaining a level divisible by 5 (level 5, 10, 15, ...).

#### Arcane Evasion

#### But Seriously, Me First  
When called to make an Initiative check, you may choose to count one of your two 10 sided dice as an automatic 10. You still roll both die and presumably choose to turn the lower of the two into a 10. You can do this after seeing the result of Boon and Bane rerolls.  
//Keeping my eye on this one. May be too much.

#### Curse Eater  
When a target suffering from a Curse you cast dies or is knocked out, you immediately heal HP and MP equal to twice your Soul. This healing increases by an amount equal to your twice your Soul each Hero Tier (so Soul x 4 at Hero Tier 2, Soul x 6 at Hero Tier 3, and so on).  
//Maybe not enough to be a capstone? Will consider additional effects.

#### Death Dealer  
Sometimes the best solution is to just hit harder. Increase your damage multiplier on all successful damaging Abilities by 1. You may only take this capstone if your Level is at least 10. This is an Exclusive Capstone, and you may only have one Exclusive Capstone.

#### Endurance Mage  
You can draw energy from your body to fuel your abilities. You may use your Toughness in place of your Mind to determine your MP.

#### Everlasting  
At the beginning of every turn, you regain HP equal to your Toughness. If you ever reach zero HP, you cease regaining HP until you are given healing from another source.  
//Scaling?

#### Finesse Caster  
You have the skill to place a spell just right--your potency is less about the power behind the spell and more about the correct application. You may use your Finesse in place of Soul to determine your Mental Attack.

#### Flight  
Your maneuverability allows you to overcome gravity, be it through magical power, transmuting wings for yourself, equipping and successfully piloting a jetpack, or similar means of propulsion. You gain the Flight property.  
This Capstone makes the [Hover](#hover) and [Slow Fall](#slow-fall) Utilities redundant. If you previously took the Hover Utility, you lose it but regain the 2 XP spent. Likewise, if you previously took the Slow Fall Utility, you lost it but regain the 4 XP spent.

#### Heavy Hitter  
You hit so hard that you can knock your foes around without actively trying to. When you make an Attack and get a Result of 10 or higher, you can choose one of the following extra effects.
* Knock your target(s) prone.
* Stagger your target(s) for a number of rounds equal to your Strength
* Move your target(s) one space. In the case of multiple targets, you must move them all in the same direction.

You have perfected an unusual spellcasting style that enables you draw fuel for your abilities from your strength. You may use Strength in place of Heart when determining your MP.

#### Serene Health  
Your heart powers your body more than your muscles. You may use Heart in place of Strength when determining your HP.

You can tap the power of your spirit to sustain your spells. You may use your Soul in place of Mind to determine your MP.

When a Ward you placed successfully reduces damage, you regain MP or HP equal to the Ward’s cost. In addition you may cast two Ward spells at a time. The Wards must be from the same spell and protect against the same element(s) but may affect different targets. You pay the cost for both.

# Chapter 9: Utilities
Broadly, Utilities are things your character can do that are not related to combat. There is no limit to the number of Utilities a character can have.   
//I’ll figure out how I want to organize these better when I’ve written more of them I think

## Skill-based Utilities
Unless otherwise stated, all Skill-based Utilities cost 3 XP.

#### Acrobatic Paragon  
Increase your Acrobatics modifier by 1.  
Your acrobatic training and anatomical knowledge allows you to help your allies unlock their potential. You grant allies Boon 2 on Acrobatics checks that you are helping them with.
//Scaling on Boon? 

#### Asceticism  
Increase your Endure modifier by 1.  
In addition, you can go 2 weeks without food or water with no ill effect, no need to make Endure checks. When you sleep, you enter a state of meditation and are still aware of the world around yourself. This enables you to awaken with full lucidity instantly and to make Awareness checks while sleeping without penalty.

#### Athletic Paragon  
Increase your Athletics modifier by 1.  
Your athletic training and anatomical knowledge allows you to help your allies unlock their potential. You grant allies Boon 2 on Athletics checks that you are helping them with.  
//Scaling on Boon? 

#### Captivating Performance  
Increase your Performance modifier by 1.  
In addition, you can utilize a performance to create a distraction for your allies in large crowds. While you perform for a room, allies attempting to move through that room unseen gain Boon 2 on Stealth checks.  
//Is this enough? Do I need to add more benefits? Increase Boon? Might be too narrow?

#### Chump Change  
Increase any two of the following by one: Construct, Craft, Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Medicine, Performance, Sabotage, Stealth, Streetwise, or Tech.  
In addition, you can generally ignore trivial-to-low cost purchases with no difficulty, and an occasional nontrivial purchase as well. On anything below an approximate equivalent to US$20, the cost can be completely ignored. In addition, you receive the approximate equivalent to $100 in extra expendable money per month of inactivity. This can represent plying a trade, working with a skill, running a con, or some similar activities during downtime.

#### Darksight
Increase your Awareness modifier by 1.
In addition, you are unaffected by low or no light conditions. This could represent extremely acute hearing, access to infrared goggles, being able to cast a spell that lets one see in darkness, or other means of bypassing darkness. This does not significantly impact your ability to be seen in darkness like carrying a flashlight would.

#### Eidetic Memory
Increase your Lore modifier by 1.
You are able to reliably remember information correctly. You may ask the Arbiter for clarification on things the character remembers but the player may not, and the Arbiter will give an accurate answer. This includes things like dates, times, names, articles in magazines, newspapers, or online.
> Player, ask the Arbiter before taking this Utility; this puts a lot more pressure on the Arbiter to remember everything. Both the Arbiter and the player should be open to improvising and handwaving if the Arbiter misremembers, and the player should do their best to help this Utility along by taking notes of things they may remember.

#### Endless Marcher  
Increase your Endure modifier by 1.  
In addition, you do not need to make Endure checks to make long marches, and have boon 4 on checks made for forced marches or while running during a chase.  

#### Extraordinary Saboteur  
Increase your Sabotage modifier by 1.  
You can also gain one of the following benefits at a time.  
* If you set up a trap, increase the necessary Investigation check requirement by your Hero Tier. //This will make more sense once I write trap mechanics.
* When destroying a device, you can set up the failure to occur after a delay. Upon successfully using Sabotage to damage the device, you can set a delay of up to ten minutes. Once used, the affected device functions normally for the specified amount of time before the malfunction you caused comes into effect.
* If dealing with a trap laid by someone else, you can temporarily bypass the thing instead of destroying it, allowing your party to pass without leaving evidence of your tampering.

#### Flawless Intuition
Increase your Investigation modifier by 1.  
In addition, you have a sixth sense when researching a topic or examining a scene. You can roll three ten sided dice on Investigation checks when doing research, searching a crime scene for clues, or other similar information gathering task, taking the highest two die rolls.  
//TODO reconsider

#### Inspiring Endurance  
Increase your Endure modifier by 1.  
Your own tenacity inspires others to push themselves harder. Your allies have Boon 1 on Endure checks.  
//Scaling on Boon?

#### Natural Intuition  
Increase your Empathy modifier by 1.  
When you successfully detect that someone is lying to you with an Empathy check, you automatically gain a small insight into their motivations. This comes as a single word. Some examples:
* The target is being blackmailed by someone who can ruin their lives, forced to work against the party. “Fear”
* The target is a petty conman and just wants to score some easy coin off the party. “Greed”
* The party includes an elf, the target is an orc, and there is still long standing, mutual dislike between elves and orcs since a war between them two decades ago. “History”
* The target is secretly after revenge against someone in the party. “Enmity”

#### Packmule  
Increase your Endure modifier by 1.  
In addition, you can carry heavy loads easily. You have Boon 4 when called to make an Athletics or Endure check for picking up heavy things or carrying large loads.

#### Pretty Penny  
Prerequisites: [Chump Change](#chump-change), at least +10 in at least one of the listed skills.  
Increase any two of the following by one: Construct, Craft, Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Medicine, Performance, Sabotage, Stealth, Streetwise, or Tech.  
In addition, you can generally ignore medium cost purchases with no difficulty, and an occasional significant purchase as well. On anything below an approximate equivalent to US$200, the cost can be completely ignored. In addition, you receive the approximate equivalent to $1000 in extra expendable money per month of inactivity. This can represent plying a trade at signficant levels of skill, working with a skill at high demand or wit extreme competence, running a particularly lucrative con, or some similar activities during downtime.

#### Rhetorical Trap  
Increase your Empathy modifier by 1.  
In addition, when you successfully note that someone is lying but cannot think of a way to reveal said falsehood, you can make a Mind check. Roll two ten sided dice and add your Mind. If the result is 15 or higher, the Arbiter should suggest a way to reveal that lie. Examples include ways to force the liar to contradict themselves or reminding the player of damning evidence. This is not always possible, in which case the Arbiter should say as much.

#### Sharp Senses  
Increase your Awareness modifier by 1.  
You are also able to rely on senses other than sight to locate opponents, improving your odds for striking hidden foes. When attacking an Obscured target with a single target attack, you can roll two ten sided dice and take the higher result instead of just rolling one.

#### Superior Stealth  
Increase your Stealth modifier by 1.  
You have a natural eye for hiding spots that helps you conceal yourself and others when you stay still. When helping allies hide, you do so with Boon 2.  
//Scaling on Boon? 

#### Well Connected  
Increase your Diplomacy modifier by 1.  
In addition, you can assume you have connections in any non-trivial settlement you travel to. This can be the result of celebrity status, being a member of a well known and respected organization, or just having a lot of friends (or friends of friends) around the realm. This person should be generally friendly and/or sympathetic to your cause (within reason) and familiar with the customs of the region. Beyond that, your connections’ details are up to the Arbiter. Discuss the ramifications of this Connection with the Arbiter before taking it so they can prepare appropriately. When coming to a new location, you can ask the Arbiter who your connection is and what you know about them.

#### Whispered Wisdom  
Increase your Lore modifier by 1.  
You can also glean information about locations or events intuitively. This can be consulting with spirits of the area, unlocking the memories of objects in the vicinity, getting brief glimpses of the past or future, consulting an advanced AI, and other ways one might gather small bits of information. You may conduct a ritual seeking the answer to a single question that takes at least one minute and make a Lore check, the difficulty of which is determined secretly by the Arbiter. If you succeed, you can get a clear yes/no answer or a short, often cryptic phrase to guide you. If you fail, there will be no answer.  
To determine the difficulty of the Lore check, the Arbiter should consider several factors. How obscure is the topic being asked about? If it’s about a location, was it the location of significant events? Are there forces at work trying to keep the information hidden? If it’s about a person, how powerful are they? (Powerful individuals tend be more difficult to learn about through this feature.)
## Other Utilities

#### Familiar
You can summon or create a small familiar to help with mundane tasks outside of combat. This could be a small animal bonded to you, a small automaton you’ve built, an object you’ve infused with life, or something similar. This familiar never participates in combat, hiding away where they will not be harmed. (For simplicity’s sake, you do not need to track the familiar during combat.) The familiar fetches objects, helps keep living areas tidy, can stand watch while your party rests, and other simple, non-violent tasks. If required to make a skill check, the Familiar’s core stats are as follows:  
Strength -2, Finesse 1, Toughness 0, Mind 1, Heart 1, Soul 1  
Physical Attack -1, Mental Attack 2, Physical Defense 11, Mental Defense 12  
Familiars usually have [Flight](#flight).  
Familiars do not gain class levels and thus only uses its base stats to modify the skill checks. (Familiars are not well suited to complex tasks or combat as a result.)  
Summoning a familiar is a ritual that requires an hour of uninterrupted work and 7 MP. This could be praying to nature spirits to send an ally, invoking the spirits of the dead to bind to a vessel, tinkering with clockwork components, or similar activities. If a familiar takes any damage at all, it immediately dies. The ritual for reviving a dead familiar or obtaining a new one is the same as acquiring the first one.  

#### Hover  
XP Cost: 2  
You can fly up to five feet off the ground.  
This could represent wings that don’t quite have the strength to fully fly, a personal anti-gravity field, a spell that produces a hovering platform, or something similar.  
While not as versatile as fully functioning flight, this allows to you avoid hazards on the floor, reaching a ledge that is otherwise too tall to get to, and any other advantage one could imagine comes with being slightly airborne.  
This does not protect you from falling damage; if you are suddenly more than five above the ground you will fall as normal.
This Power makes you immune to Terrain effects with the [Grounded] tag, unless the caster possesses the [Reaching Terrain](#reaching-terrain) Power.

#### One with Nature: Animals  
XP Cost: 3  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with animals. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you gain a basic understanding of animal speech.  
Animals have simple, instinctual desires and are usually very focused on the here and now. Most quickly dismiss past events that don’t affect their ability to survive and don’t really understand “the future” as a concept.

#### One with Nature: Minerals  
XP Cost: 3  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with minerals. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you have learned to tap into a subtle consciousness that is present in stone, metal, and gems.  
Minerals have long memories, but no ability to move and thus a very limited frame of reference. They also have a difficult time telling moving things apart; seeking information about a specific person while speaking to stone is unlikely to be fruitful unless no one else has passed by in a very long time.  
You may only use this method of communication to speak with unworked minerals. The process of cutting gems for jewelry or forging metal for equipment “kills” the materials, rendering them silent to you.

#### One with Nature: Plants  
XP Cost: 3  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with plants. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you can hear the thoughts of plants from the smallest weed to the largest tree.  
If they are getting adequate resources to grow, plants are generally pleasant conversationalists, often talking about weather patterns or similar topics. Trees will discuss the lives of the animals living within their branches, and grasses will talk about grazers coming for them and being stepped on.

#### Sixth Sense  
XP Cost: 5  
You have a innate ability to sense supernatural influences. This can be angelic, demonic, undead, fey, eldritch, or anything between. When you focus your senses, you can detect if a supernatural being is within thirty feet of you. You know the creature’s general location and what sort of creature it is. You can also sense when supernatural forces have tampered with otherwise natural processes in a residual way.

#### Speak with the Ancient Dead  
XP Cost: 5  
Prerequisite: [Speak with the Recently Dead](#speak-with-the-recently-dead)  
Your ability to speak with corpses improves; now all that is required is an intact skull. The state of the rest of the body does not matter.

#### Speak with the Recently Dead  
XP Cost: 5  
You can speak with corpses. The corpses know everything they knew in life, up until the last day of their lives, which they completely forget. Corpses in this state have no emotions, and cannot learn new information, including the fact that they are dead. They also cannot move. The corpse must still have enough lungs and vocal cords to be able speak, or this Utility fails. This could be harnessing necromancy, utilizing nanobots to reconstruct what the body's brain knew, being an effective medium, knowledge of certain rituals, or similar measures.

#### Speak with the Recently Dead, Improved  
XP Cost: 7  
Prerequisite: [Speak with the Recently Dead](#speak-with-the-recently-dead), Hero Tier 2  
You can learn more from corpses; corpses you speak with in this way now remember everything the knew up to the moment of their death. If you also have (Speak with the Ancient Dead)[#speak-with-the-ancient-dead] this effect extends to them.

#### Slow Fall  
XP Cost: 4  
You are able to reduce the injuries you take when falling by half. This might represent gliding down with wings, casting a spell that cushions your descent, a device that reduces your falling speed, or just training to be better able to reduce the injuries that come from falling.

# Chapter 10: Combat
<Talk about how combat is often an inevitable aspect of adventuring, and also a source of a lot of excitement and climactic moments, that kind of thing.>//

## Time in Combat
The flow of strikes and parries, spells and counterspells, and so on has to be tightly organized to make sense. As with most turn based games, these are organized into rounds and turns. Each set of actions a character takes constitutes that character’s “turn”. A set of everyone taking their turn is called a “round” and represents approximately 10 seconds in game.

### Surprise/Ambush
The Shaper determines who might be surprised in a given scenario. It often involves awareness checks against stealth checks, but different situations may call for different rolls. If a creature is surprised, it doesn’t act in the first round of combat, nor can it make reactions during the first round.

### Initiative
Before combat can begin, everyone needs to know the order that combat is happening in. This is determined by the initiative roll. Everyone simply rolls normally, adding their Finesse and any other modifiers. The person with the highest result goes first, followed by the next highest, and so on until everyone has had a turn.  
If there’s a tie, the creature with the higher Initiative modifier goes first. If that’s still a tie, then the two creatures make an opposed tiebreaker roll.  
You may choose to delay your turn if you like. When your turn comes, you simply declare who you want your turn to come after instead. On the next round, your initiative order returns to where it originally was.

### Taking a Turn
When your turn comes, you get two Actions to work with: one Major and one Minor. Anything that would affect the state of the fight will fall into one of those two categories, and Abilities list in their descriptions whether they are a Major or Minor Action to use. Things such as speaking or movements that don’t really change the state of the fight do not require an Action. You may forgo any combination of your Actions if you don’t want to take them on your turn; you’re not required to use them.  
Between your turns, you have one Counter Action. Some Abilities allow you to use this action to do something on another combatant's turn. Abilities that requires a Counter Action will list a condition that must be fulfilled before the action can be used.

> When it’s not your turn, you should be considering what your next action is going to be. Just because someone else is doing the talking doesn’t mean you should stop thinking. Actively planning your turn during your friends’ actions means the game will be faster and more fun for everyone.

## Moving and Positioning
Knowing who you can reach and who can reach you is critical in combat, so these rules are here to help you keep up with the flow of a fight.  
Combat is broken up into zones. A combat zone should generally be somewhere between 20-40 feet in length, square-ish in shape, and easy to understand on a quick drawing. It may represent a room or a hallway. A great hall in a large building may have several zones. An open field would just be an effectively infinite number of zones that characters can move through freely. Multiple creatures can occupy a single zone, and unless there is an Ability or circumstance saying otherwise everyone is able to get into melee range of everyone else in the same zone.  
Characters can (usually) move to any adjacent zones by spending a minor action. This might represent running, jumping, climbing, swimming, or any other kind of motion to get around, in any combination. 

### Terrain
Terrain can influence how one moves significantly. Some zone borders may require skill checks to cross, cause damage, require a major action to move through, restrict how many characters can move through each turn, or something similar.  
//TODO Fill this out

### Attacking
Blows will be exchanged often in combat.  
//TODO Fill in more fluff, IDK  
To make an attack, first you roll your 2d10 as normal, and add your modifier. If the Ability you are using to strike is labeled as an Attack, you use Physical Attack. Abilities labeled as Spells instead add your Mental Attack. Once you have this result, subtract your target’s defense score, Physical Defense for Attacks and Mental Defense for Spells (though there are exceptions which will be described in those abilities’ descriptions). The result is called the Impact, and if the Impact is above zero, your attack has landed and will affect your opponent. By and large this will mean dealing damage, but some abilities instead impose conditions or something else unpleasant when they land. The amount of damage you deal is determined by multiplying your Impact by the Ability’s damage multiplier.

## Chasing rules
Sometimes when two opposing factions meet, one is not willing to stand and fight. This can result in a chase scene, in which one party is trying to get away from a pursuing party. In future the individual or group being chased will be called the Quarry, while the one(s) doing the chasing will be the Hunter.

### Position During Chases
During a chase, exact position doesn’t necessarily matter as much as distance between the Quarry and the Hunter. There is no need to make a large map to have a chase. Instead, assign each participant in the chase a number, representing how far they are from the chase’s starting point. This number is called the character’s Position, and it determines what they can do to other participants in the chase. At the start of the chase, the Hunter that’s farthest from the Quarry should be assigned Position 0, with others in the chase being assigned Positions based on how far from this starting point they are. Any action or effect that would cause you to move allows you to instead increase (or decrease) your Position by 1.

### Endurance
A chase is as much about endurance as it is about speed. You start every chase with an Endurance score equal to your Hero Tier + Toughness + Heart. You can spend Endurance to use one of the actions described below, or preserve it in order to continue a long-distance chase.  
At the end of every round during a chase, everyone involved that moved that round must make an Endure check. This check starts at a target of 10, and on a success nothing happens other than the target increasing by 2 the next turn. On a failure, you lose one point of Endurance and the Endure check’s difficulty goes back to 10 for the next turn.  
If your Endurance score goes negative, you lose that much HP every time you move a square of your own volition.

### Actions During Chases
There are a few things one can do that is specific to chase scenes to consider.

#### Use Abilities
All Abilities available to you outside of a chase scene are available during chases as well. In order to use a Melee range Ability, your Position must match your target’s. To use a Close range Ability, your Position must be within 1 of your target’s; for Medium, 2; for Long, 3. Abilities that did only damage previously still do so, but any Ability that affects movement can be used to get an upper hand during the chase.

#### Sprint
Sprinting is a Major Action, and allows you to move three Positions at once. Doing this costs a point of Endurance.

#### Recover
Recovery is a Major Action, and you cannot use your Minor Action to do anything that causes you to move. This recovers one point of Endurance, up to a maximum of your Hero Tier + Toughness + Heart.

#### Lose Them
Lose Them requires both your Major and Minor actions, and is only available when your Concealment score is higher than all of your Hunters Momentum. When you use Lose Them, you make a Stealth check opposed by the Hunter with the highest Momentum’s Awareness check (hereafter referred to as the Lead Hunter). You gain Boon to this Stealth check for every point of Concealment above the Lead Hunter’s Momentum.  
For example, Alex has Concealment 5 and decides to try to lose his pursuers. Among his Hunters, Carol has the highest Momentum at 3. This means that Alex makes his Stealth check against Carol’s Awareness with Boon 2.  
If you succeed in this Stealth check, the Hunters completely lose track of you. If you choose to continue moving away you will exit the scene altogether.  
If you fail in this Stealth check, you lose one point of Concealment.  

#### Chase Participation after Losing Them
If you have allies that are still being chased, or for other reasons want to continue harrying the Hunters, you may continue in the chase, unable to be targeted by the Hunters for any reason. You continue in the chase like this, keeping track of your Position as normal. At the end of every round, you must make a Stealth check against the Lead Hunter’s Awareness check or be spotted and lose half of your concealment. If at any point the Lead Hunter’s Momentum score exceeds your Concealment score, you are automatically spotted and must participate in the chase normally again.

# Chapter 11: Exploration
// TODO Figure out what goes here, I’m not sure

***
# Chapter X: Health, Injury, Death, and Recovery
//Working on issues that will come up in playtesting. This won’t necessarily be the final order.  
In the course of your group’s story, the players will face adversity. They will endure pain. Flesh fails, bones break, and blood flows. This is a part of adventuring, and all adventures make their own peace with this reality in time. This section of the rulebook will describe the rules that govern this grim part of the hero’s journey.

## What are HP?
HP (hit points or health points, both work) are an extremely abstract representation of a character’s health. While the character still has HP, they can still press on. At a glance this could just be how much punishment the character can endure, but one could (and I think SHOULD) take it farther than that. Endurance, pain tolerance, mental fortitude, and dumb luck can all be part of a character’s HP maximum.

### What does it mean to lose HP?
Losing HP does not necessarily mean being struck by a weapon or spell. Remember, HP are abstract. Losing HP can be represented by narrowly avoiding a brutal attack (and thus using up one’s luck). It could be parrying a heavy blow, but suffering significant pain in one’s arm from the effort (testing one’s pain tolerance). It could be expending internal energy to throw an arcane shield up to deflect a spell (draining one’s endurance). And, maybe in the end, it could be getting a knife in the back. One should take getting hit as an opportunity for creativity, just like dealing a hit.

## What types of damage are there?
Broadly speaking, there are eight types of damage. Some beings may be vulnerable to some types, resistant or even immune to others. Ideally a party has a variety of damage types to work with with and can adjust to the enemy’s makeup as you go. Players are unlikely to know what types of damages work well upon first encountering a creature. They can use Scan Abilities to determine their targets’ elemental properties, or try experimenting. Some things are reasonable to guess; an ice monster probably doesn’t like fire and doesn’t mind ice for example.

The damage types are as follows:
* *Physical* - Slashing, piercing, bashing. Being damaged by physical damage means. This is by far the most common type of damage.
   * //If you see damage listed without a clear damage type, PLEASE CONTACT ME so I can label it, but you may also assume it is Physical.
* *Fire* - Burning, scorching, heat. Fire damage is broadly the way to describe damage that comes from using high temperatures.
* *Ice* - Piercing with icicles, chilling winds, sucking the heat out of the air. If the damage source is primarily low temperatures, it is ice damage.
* *Sky* - Zapping with lightning, being struck by slashing winds, and similar things. If it’s about electricity or wind, the damage type is Sky.
* *Earth* - Earth damage can be from launched rocks, being struck by plant vines, or a dip in acid. This is one of the more eclectic damage types, but it encompasses everything themed around the earth, from stones to the plants that grow from it.
* *Light* - Blinding radiance, searing lasers, holy light. Any time light itself is weaponized, it is light damage.
* *Dark* - Consuming blackness, draining life, unholy blight. If the damage comes from utilizing darkness or draining away the health of others, it is dark damage.
* *Almighty* - Beyond definition and comprehension, power in its rawest form. Almighty damage is extremely rare, and no force in existence can resist it.

With the exception of Almighty damage, enemies may have resistances or weaknesses to any combination of these damage types. A character can tell when they have struck a resistance or weakness as their blow lands; the results should be dramatically different from their expectations and make it very clear what is happening.

> TODO Finish this: There should be a sidebar here cautioning Shapers to not go overboard on Physical resistance since that is the only damage type all characters can guaranteed do. I also want to talk about how to gauge when it’s right to try to specifically hand players something they can deal with and when it needs to be a challenge. 

## What are Injuries?
When you lose all HP, you take an injury and fall unconscious. You can’t move, take actions, and are completely unaware of your surroundings. Anything that would cause additional damage while you’re at zero HP causes an additional injury.  
Injuries in Story Shaper are the decidedly less abstract consequences of failing certain tasks or running out of HP. An injury reduces one of your Attributes by one until it is tended to.  
When you sustain an injury, you take that single six sided die that is listed in Story Shaper’s required components and roll. The type of injury inflicted is decided by the die result.
1. *Strength*. You’ve torn a muscle, broken a bone, lost so much blood that you can’t pack the same kind of punch as you used to, or something similar.
2. *Finesse*. You’ve torn a ligament, broken your fingers, sustained nerve damage that makes movement difficult or painful, or otherwise lost mobility. 
3. *Toughness*. You’ve broken a rib and/or punctured a lung, lost a lot of blood, or otherwise picked up some affliction that makes you less vigorous than your best.
4. *Mind*. You’ve suffered a concussion, have sight damage, are dealing with temporary memory loss, or some other problem that makes you duller than usual.
5. *Soul*. You’ve suffered pain that breaks through your resolve, have a ringing in your ears, are generally questioning yourself, or something that interrupts your inner tranquility. 
6. *Heart*. You’ve suffered a concussion, severe pain, perhaps perceive a betrayal (real or imagined) that makes you less sociable for the time being.

As always, these methods of describing an injury are just suggestions. Players and Shapers are free to come up with their own.

### How can I get Injured?
There are many dangers in an adventure that can result in an injury. The most obvious is hitting zero HP in combat, but this isn’t the only way. Here is a quick list of other ways to be injured. (Note that not all injury types are suitable in all circumstances. The Shaper makes this choice and adjusts injury rolls appropriately. For example, if the dice roll a Heart injury from falling, the Shaper may choose to reroll until something appropriate comes up.)
* Falling. Falling from a great height will typically result in injuries. For every 30 feet one falls, one will sustain an additional injury. Characters can make an Acrobatics check to try and reduce the damage from falling, reducing the height fallen by half the check’s result. Characters with [Flight](#flight) generally don’t need to worry about falling damage. Falling can cause Strength, Finesse, or Toughness injuries.
* Poison/Venom. The various creatures of the world may secrete harmful substances as they attack you. These will be listed in each creature’s information. A bite from a giant spider may cause a Finesse injury, while breathing in the spores of a territorial fungus might cause a Mind injury. These injuries can often be resisted with Endure checks.
* Traps. Slides into a spiked floor, arrows launched when a pressure plate is depressed, a bladed pendulum set to swing by a trip wire--these sorts of devious perils may cause HP damage, but they may instead leave lingering injuries. These are described individually. They can typically be avoided with Awareness, Athletics, and/or Acrobatics checks. They can be disabled entirely with Sabotage checks.
* Fatigue. Circumstance forces a character to march throughout the night, forgoing food, water, and rest, through driving rain and cold and without shelter. This will wear on the character, and the compounding fatigue that builds up over time of neglect is represented with injuries.
   * When going without sleep for a night, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take a random injury. On a success, you soldier on, but the next night you have to go without sleep you repeat the check with +5 difficulty. This continues stacking until you sleep for at least six hours. Failing this check does not reset the difficulty; only sleep can do that.
   * After two weeks without food, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take an injury to strength, endurance, or dexterity. On a success, you can do without for a little longer. Every day spent without eating from here on requires another Endure check with +1 difficulty. This stacks until you get a good meal.
   * After three days without water, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take a random injury. On a success, you can do without for a little longer. Every day spent without water from here on requires another Endure check with +4 difficulty. This stacks until you get a drink.
   * Every day spent without shelter from severe rain, cold, or heat requires an Endure check, difficulty determined by the Shaper based on the conditions. Failure results in an injury appropriate to the situation.


These are just a few examples, and the Shaper can likely come up with more in their games.

## How can I Recover?
An interesting question, and there are several ways to approach recovery of HP, MP, and injuries. Here are some recommended options (beyond healing Abilities, of course).

* *Rapid, heroic pulp*.  The heroes bounce back from activity quickly, showing boundless energy. In this case, heroes regain all HP/MP after resting for 5 minutes. Recovering from an injury requires resting for an hour, which heals one injury of the player’s choice. 
   * This recovery method emphasizes action, enables risk taking, and encourages blowing everything quickly. This will result in faster battles since everyone is going full tilt at all times. Whatever happens will happen fast. 
* *Middle ground*. The heroes typically need a break after a dangerous encounter, and a long day of peril will wear them down. In this mode, resting for an hour regenerates HP equal to your Toughness + Character level and MP equal to your Heart + Character level (minimum 1 HP/MP per hour). Resting for eight hours straight regenerates all HP and MP and heals one injury. If the character is tended to by someone during this time, the tender may attempt a Medicine check, difficulty 10 + the number of injuries the target has received. On a success, the target heals two additional injuries during their rest. 
   * This recovery system is a compromise, encouraging players not to blow everything immediately, but still potentially rewards explosive action and risk taking when appropriate.
* *Survival*. Damage lingers. Injuries will pile up. MP are precious. In this dangerous format, resting for eight hours regenerates HP equal to your Toughness + Character level and MP equal to your Heart + Character level. Healing from an injury requires two full days of bed rest. If the character is tended to by someone during this time, the tender may attempt a Medicine check, difficulty 10 + the number of injuries the target has received. On a success, you heal an injury every day instead of every two days. 
   * In this format, you must track resources carefully and spend them dearly. Players are likely encouraged to avoid combat when possible and play extremely frugally when it does happen.
* *Action Movie* - Low HP, High Injury, Instant Recovery. And now for something completely different. In this format, all characters’ maximum HP are halved. When they hit zero HP they still receive an injury as normal, but instead of going unconscious they instead regain their maximum HP. Use the same injury rules as either Heroic Pulp or Middle Ground recovery, Shaper’s choice.
   * This mode has a specific purpose: to capture the action movie brawl. Two opponents square off, striking at each other for a period until eventually one gets an advantage and lands a powerful series of blows on the other. There’s a painful sound as the scene slows down, showing the loser of the exchange reeling in pain while the victor gets a moment to gloat. The loser then refocuses and continues the fight, but a bit shakier, until one or the other cannot stand any longer.

These are recommendations that should provide a good variety, suitable to most types of games.

## How does Death Work?
There is a point past which a character’s body can no longer endure injury, and they perish. For the enemies, this threshold should be quite low. Expendable sorts who play no major role in the story should likely just die immediately when their HP are spent. Plot centric characters may have a higher threshold, three to five. The death of a player character has much larger implications on the game and should be considered more carefully. My recommendation is to declare a character with ten injuries dead.  
//TODO THIS NEED PLAYTESTING, not going to write more until I have more data here.

### Is Resurrection a Thing?
That is up to the Shaper and should suit the setting. Allowing resurrection invites some serious questions. How common is it? What does it require? What stops the bad guys from being raised after the heroes are done with them? I am not going to set down hard rules for resurrecting dead player character, because it should be custom to each setting. It’s worth noting that players are NOT necessarily entitled to this information. It’s up to the Shaper.

## Conditions and Properties
#### Blind  
You cannot see. If you attempt to attack a target that you can hear or whose location you know without need for sight, you only roll a single ten sided die for the attack. You cannot effectively defend yourself while blinded as well, so attacks against you gain Boon 6.

#### Flight  
You can fly. This allows you to move into the airborne parts of the battle grid. Airborne movement is otherwise identical to standard movement.
This Condition makes you immune to Terrain effects with the [Grounded] tag, unless the caster possesses the [Reaching Terrain](#reaching-terrain) Power.

#### Grappled  
Grabbed by another target who currently has control of the situation. You cannot move willingly. You have Bane 9. Attacks against you have Boon 2. You can end this condition by spending a Minor action to attempt an Acrobatics or Athletics check, opposed by your opponent’s Athletics check.

#### Grappling  
Grabbing another target and in control of the situation. You may move both yourself and your victim as a Minor action. Attacking a target other than the one you are currently Grappling ends the grapple.  
Attacks against you from targets other than the one you are grappling have Boon 2. Attacks you make against the one you are grappling have Boon 3. You may end this condition at any time without an action, which also frees your victim from the Grappled condition.

#### Obscured  
You are invisible or otherwise very difficult to see, which makes you extremely difficult to hit or track. Any foe that is able to target you with a single target attack makes said attack with only a single ten sided die. (Obscured provides no benefit against area of effect attacks.) You also gain Boon 6 on Stealth checks.

#### Prone  
Lying on the ground. Melee range attacks against Prone targets have Boon 5, while any attacks coming from beyond Short range are made at Bane 8. Moving a square while Prone costs a major action.  
You may fall Prone or stand up as a minor action. 

#### Provoked
An opponent has demanded your attention. Any actions you take that affect opponents must include the creature that Provoked you, including any area of effect or curse effects. This may represent an opponent shouting insults to grab attention, minor mind control, jamming targeting systems, or other similar ways to demand attention in combat.

#### Stagger  
Knocked silly. While Staggered, you lose your Minor action and have Bane 10. Unless a different duration is listed, Staggers only last one round (or six seconds outside of Initiative).

# Chapter Y: Adversaries and Monsters
/* TODO For now this is going to be where I list and describe monsters written. Eventually I need to write a more concrete introduction about how to use monsters, notes about how the entries are kept generic with a few details left unwritten so one entry can potentially represent many different types of monsters, how to read these entries, and the like. For now I want to skip to actually sharing monster entries to give an idea of how I would want these entries to be read by Shapers and used in games.  
Figure out how to explain adversary archetypes at some point. Add notes about figuring out skill mods when they’re not listed.
*/

## Creeps
Creeps represent enemies who rely on cheap tricks and numbers. Individually they usually aren’t that dangerous, but adventurers will never actually encounter creatures like these alone. They fight by trying to pile onto individual targets and overwhelm them with sheer numbers. In generally they should be small or scrawny creatures. These can be creatures like goblins, kobolds, imps, small and disposable aliens in part of a hive mind, and the like.  
Their elemental properties should generally be unimpressive: at best they resist as many elements as they are weak to. Perhaps they even have more weaknesses than resistances. For example, the modern image of a kobold is a creature that spends its life in caves. This could mean they resist earth but are weak to sky and fire. Goblins are sometimes depicted having an affinity for gunpowder, so perhaps they resist fire and are weak to ice and earth.

**Lesser Creep**  
Strength 1  
Finesse 1  
Toughness 0  
Mind -1  
Soul -1  
Heart -1  
HP Max: 8  
MP Max: 0  
Physical Attack: 2  
Mental Attack: -2  
Physical Defense: 11  
Mental Defense: 8  

*Melee strike* (Major action attack), x1 multiplier, physical, melee.  
*Hoard Tactics* (Passive): If in a square with two other allied Creeps, Melee Strike has +1 attack. 

Lesser Creeps are the lowest of the low. They are dull witted and easily coerced. They likely have little regard for their own well being, flinging themselves into combat not expecting to survive.

## Nuisances
The Nuisance archetype represents small, elusive adversaries that utilize mental attacks against the heroes. These may appear in groups with other nuisances, or assist a more impressive threat as minor support. They generally shouldn’t appear alone, as their low hit points means individuals will typically be dealt with quickly. Example nuisances include pixies, will o’ wisps, imps, elemental motes, and the like.  
Elementally, Nuisances should have one resistance (which also determines the damage type of their attacks) and one weakness. A pixie might utilize Sky attacks while being weak to Fire. Imps that serve greater demonic masters may use bolts of Dark while being expelled by Light. These combinations should typically be straightforward.
   
**Lesser Nuisance**  
Strength -1  
Finesse 2  
Toughness -1  
Mind 2  
Soul 0  
Heart 1  
HP Max: 5  
MP Max: 8  
Physical Attack: 1  
Mental Attack: 3  
Physical Defense: 12  
Mental Defense: 13  

*Elusive* (Passive): Physical damage against this target is halved.  
*Zap* (Major action spell): x1 multiplier, medium range. Damage type is the same as this creature’s elemental resistance. 1 MP  
*Fuddle* (Major action auxiliary): Curse, medium range, duration 2 rounds, must succeed on mental attack or it fails. Imposes Bane 2. 1 MP  
Crack (Major action attack): x2 multiplier, melee range. Damage type is the same as this creature’s elemental resistance. 4 MP  
Hover (Minor action auxiliary): Move one square and ignore a single Terrain effect for one round. 2 MP  

Lesser Nuisances are just what the name implies: annoying, hard to pin down, but not particularly dangerous on their own.

## Warrior
The Warrior archetype represents creatures trained in combat that utilize physical attacks against the players. They generally will prefer to get into melee range to deal high damage. They may appear in groups with Archers or other similar types who can benefit from their strengths and/or cover their weaknesses. They fight intelligently and will prioritize casters and archers where possible.

**Lesser Warrior**  
Strength 2  
Finesse 1  
Toughness 2  
Mind 0  
Soul -1  
Heart -1  
HP Max: 24  
MP Max: 8  
Physical Attack: 5  
Mental Attack: -1  
Physical Defense: 14  
Mental Defense: 9  

*Jab* (Major action attack): x1 melee range, physical damage. No cost.  
*Bash* (Major action attack): x2 melee range, physical damage, if Result is 5 or greater then the target and the Lesser Warrior move to an adjacent square. 3 HP cost.

Lesser Warriors are basic, every day fighters. These might be town guards or freshly trained soldiers in an army. Alternatively, they could be roughly human sized monstrous warriors of any type.

# Appendix A: Optional Rules
These are just extra rules that aren't necessary for the game to run, but if you're interested in a bit more to work with these are things to consider.

## Flavor Skills
The Core Skills may determine whether or not a character survives a given situation. They can reflect some things about a characters’ personality, but are also important to consider from a mechanical standpoint. Not all skills have to be this way however. If allowed by the Arbiter, all characters start with 8 flavor skill points and gain an addition 3 every time they buy skill points with XP. These can only be put into Skills that flesh out the character’s personality, reflecting hobbies or a trade that they have outside of their adventuring. Checks involving these skills may only come up rarely, and are not meant to solve real problems the character will face. The following list contains some examples, but by no means all of them. Players should talk with their Arbiter if something they think their character would want to be good at isn’t on this list.

#### Academics (Type)  
Attributes: Mind, Heart  
Advanced knowledge about a specific subject, as well as the knowledge of how to handle oneself in academic spaces for the subject. For example, in a modern/sci-fi setting this could represent a degree from a university. In medieval settings, this could represent an unusual opportunity to learn more than average peasants. Examples of types include Literature, Mathematics, Computer Science, Psychology, ect.

#### Art  
Attributes: Heart, Soul  
Painting, poetry, writing. In general this skill represents your ability to create works of art.

#### Cooking  
Attributes: Heart, Soul  
Making food look and taste better, faster. This could represent spending time as a cook at a restaurant, gourmet studies, or just a lot of time in a kitchen trying things and seeing what works.

#### Gambling  
Attributes: Finesse, Mind  
Calculating odds on the fly. Knowing how to bend the rules of a given game to improve one’s payout. If the character would go that far, cheating.

#### Gaming (Dexterity)  
Attributes: Finesse, Mind  
Knowing how to throw the ball or hit the puck just right. This covers games like horseshoes, darts, pool, Crokinole, and similar games.

#### Gaming (Strategic)  
Attributes: Toughness, Mind  
Learning rules quickly and bending them to your purposes on the fly. Seeing opportunities. Min/maxing. This covers games like Chess, Civilization, Eurogames, and the like.

#### Music (Instrument)  
Attributes: Finesse, Heart  
Technical skill with a given instrument. Instruments include violin, voice, guitar, trumpet, flute, synths, ect.
> Perform vs. Music: A performance can be made without an instrument or music at all. Perform checks represent one’s ability to captivate an audience by whatever means you can. It may be that you use a Music check as a part of a Perform check. In this case you make the Music check first, and if it goes well it may confer a benefit to the Perform check while a poor result will impose penalties.

#### Sport (Type)  
Attributes: Strength, Toughness  
Skill and experience playing a given sport. Types include football, baseball, basketball, and so on.
> Athletics vs. Sport: Generally speaking, an Athletics check should be made as part of all Sport checks, adding a benefit to the Sport check if it’s good and a penalty if it’s bad. People who know the fine details of the rules and who have studied the best techniques should have an advantage over opponents lacking that practice, so a character with Sport checks should have a significantly higher chance to win a given event than someone competing with raw Athletics.

#### Trade (Type)  
Attributes: Toughness, Mind  
Knowing how to make a living in a given business. This can represent any profession that doesn’t really fit into one of the other skills. Example Types include Waiter, Handyman, Merchant, Doctor, Herbalist.
> This Skill is focused on the business side of things. For example, a character may have very high Medicine skill that makes them able to provide a valuable service, but if they have no points in Trade (Doctor) they would struggle with paperwork and business decisions that they need to make to have a profitable business from their practice.

## Tricks
Tricks represent minor things a character can do that don’t affect combat, but make life a little easier. Many Tricks will only be appropriate in fantasy or sci-fi settings, but some of these can work in more grounded settings. They can represent anything from fine control over fire magic to reliably having a lighter. Tricks can either be purchased in sets of 3 for 1 XP, or come along with some Abilities or Powers. If you spend XP to learn some Tricks and later learn an Ability or Power that grants a Trick you already know, you may learn a new Trick. Once learned, a Trick can be used at will. The Tricks available (along with any Abilities/Powers that grant them for free) are described below.  

#### Chill  
You can generate a feeling of cold. This can a small ice spell, triggering an endothermic chemical reaction, or something similar. If the cold comes from a device, it can be assumed to always have fuel. You are immune to discomfort from your own Chill, and the cold--though deeply uncomfortable--is not strong enough to cause HP damage. The chill is not enough to counteract hot weather. This can be used to chill drinks, make ice, preserve food, or similar applications.  
Granted By: Elemental Attunement (Ice)

#### Clean  
You can quickly clean a surface. This can be magically wiping away dirt and grime, setting a robotic assistant to the task, or something similar. This cleaning does not repair any damage done to the object or assemble anything taken apart, but dirt, rust, mold, and any other sort of non-magical grime comes away quickly when this Trick is used. This can also be used to dry off wet surfaces. Clean can be used safely on living creatures without harming them.  
Granted By: Cleanse

#### Lift  
You can manipulate objects from a distance. This can be due to magical or psychic power, having drones with manipulator arms, or something similar. For the purposes of how much can be lifted, treat Lift as having Strength -1. If the force comes from a device, it can be assumed to always have fuel. Lift cannot be used to take an item from another creature’s person or to manipulate tiny creatures.  
Granted By: Kinetic Dart

#### Light  
You can generate light. This can be a radiant spell, carrying a flashlight, or something similar. If the light comes from a device, it can be assumed to always have fuel. You can cause the light to radiate outward, in which case it illuminates squares all around you out to Close range (about 20 feet), or to shine out like a cone or flashlight, in which case it illuminates squares in a direction out to Long range (about 60 feet). This light does not penetrate magical darkness.  
Granted By: Elemental Attunement (Light)

#### Mend  
You can fix minor damage done to items. This can be magically willing the damage to be fixed or having the tools and know-how to do the repairs manually. This only repairs small amounts of damage--a tear in cloth, a dent in armor, a crack in glass, and so on. If the object in question is actually broken, Mend is ineffective.  
Granted By: Healing Word, Healing Touch


#### Shadow  
You can create shadowy figures or manipulate your shadow unnaturally. This can be sneaky usage of darkness magic, employing holograms, or similar procedures. When producing an image, it can occupy an area up to a cube with four foot sides. It can be as detailed and colorful as you like, but it will always be slightly transparent. It cannot produce light. When manipulating your shadow, you can cause it to take a different shape, produce faces or symbols on it, increase its size up to 50%, decrease its size up to 50%, or similar effects.  
Granted By: Elemental Attunement (Dark)

#### Spark  
You can generate a small flame. This can be a flame you light on your finger with fire magic, a simple lighter you keep in your gear, or something similar. If the flame comes from a device, it can be assumed to always have fuel. You are immune to harm from your own Spark, and the flame generated is not hot enough to cause HP damage, though it is still painful to touch for others. The warmth it provides is not enough to exist comfortably in low temperatures. This spark is enough to ignite flammable substances as normal.  
Granted By: Elemental Attunement (Fire)


#### Sprout  
You can grow and manipulate plants. This can be a gentle application of earth or sylvan magic, a chemical concoction that causes rapid plant growth, or something similar. You can assume you always have the materials you need to perform this Trick. If working from nothing, you can cause small amounts of moss, grasses, or vines to grow, along with a single flower of whatever color you desire. If working from a seed or an existing plant, you can cause the seed to sprout, blooms to grow or change color, leaves and branches to grow, fruit to ripen, or damage to heal. (This does not heal HP damage dealt to plant-like creatures.) This Trick is not enough to grow food on its own but if used on existing crop plants it can double the rate at which they grow. Sprout cannot render poisonous plants safe to eat.  
Granted By: Elemental Attunement (Earth)


#### Static  
You can generate small electric shocks. This can be subtle use of air magic, a glove that stores and releases electric charge, or something similar. If the electricity comes from a device, it can be assumed to always have fuel. You are immune to discomfort from your own Static, and the voltage generated is not enough to cause HP damage--though it can still be a painful surprise. This Trick can be used to power small devices or recharge batteries, but anything larger than two feet in diameter requires a dedicated power source to function continuously.  
Granted By: Elemental Attunement (Sky)
