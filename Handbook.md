# Chapter 0: Introduction
Assembled friends and enemies, welcome to the Story Shaper System (S3).  

## Who am I?  
Online I go by Proven Paradox; Dox for short, Josh if you prefer a normal name; he/him. I have been playing tabletop roleplaying games for over two decades. I've been a game designer just as long--writing homebrew content for my campaigns, programming small video games, and analyzing and mastering games created by others.

## What is Story Shaper System?  
S3 is a setting-agnostic RPG system that is focused on being smooth and entertaining as a game, while being flexible enough to run any genre. You only need ten-sided dice.  
These ideas are central to the design of Story Shaper. 

* **Freedom.** The rules have been written to allow players to describe their actions however they want. There are not (and never will be) any rules that restrain what your character looks like in this book. While the abilities and skills on your character sheet make some implications about *what* a character can do, the player describes *how* they do it.  
* **Depth.** The "game" portion of this roleplaying game focuses on strategic character building, compelling problem solving, and interesting moment to moment decisions. Combat rewards tactical thinking and teamwork. A character's non-combat options allow players to flesh out what kind of person their character is.  
* **Speed.** If a given task might not be fun for some players, S3 makes that task quick, easy, and painless. Combat is simplified in a way that reduces analysis paralysis. Ideally, an experienced player who knows their character should take more than two minutes to figure out the rules for their actions. (Of course, one may take considerably more time deliberating on tactical options or describing their actions.)  
* **Versatility.** This system is intended to be usable in any genre. Sci-fi, fantasy, superheroes, or whatever setting you can come up with. Spells could be re-imagined as gunslinger trick shots in an old-west flavored campaign. You could reframe combat as a battle of words between philosophers, giving fiery speeches against cold hearts. With some restrictions on which options are available, S3 could even be used for a story grounded in reality.

# Chapter 1: How to Play
One of the most important things separating a roleplaying game from simple pretend is the addition of rules. In a game with no rules, it can be difficult to make something bad happen to another character. And a story where nothing bad happens to the heroes has no sense of adversity. Maybe that doesn’t bother you, in which case feel free to get with friends and have a great time just playing pretend with each other, societal norms be damned. But if you want to participate in a story where the stakes are high, danger is everywhere, and you don’t know what will happen to your character, you need rules and randomization to make things unpredictable.  

> Hello. This is Dox. We're in a box right now. Text in a Dox Box is me speaking to the reader directly rather than as part of the rules. In these, I'll add clarifications, examples, and recommendations to help understand the rules or run the game smoothly.  

## What you Need to Play
### Required:
* An Arbiter. This is S3's term for game master; the person running everything other than the heroes.
* At least one player.
* Access to this page: https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md  
* Each player will need a [Character sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SpLmm85PxUhJBP4AtJBr99vJqZO9HvnlGro7OmUJT9A/edit?usp=sharing).
* A pair of 10-sided dice for each player (also called d10s). *ALL* rolls in S3 are made with d10s; any time "die" or "dice" are referenced in the rules, it is always a d10.
  * Alternatively a random number generator, which can be found for free online.
> If you are playing a character focused on doing elemental damage, you may want to bring three dice.  

### Recommended but not vital:
* Pencil and paper.  
> Do not use pen or something you can’t easily erase. Trust me.
* A play mat with grid sections large enough to house multiple characters or a dry erase surface to help keep track of character positions.
* A notebook for each player to write personal notes in.
* The Arbiter can refer to the [Adversaries and Monsters page](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Adversaries-and-Monsters.md#adversaries-and-monsters) for pre-created enemies to pit players against.  
* Access to a search engine or an agreement among participants to not worry too much about what would actually happen in a given unusual situation.  
> This might be limited to the Arbiter in some settings. In settings where access to the Internet or an equivalent is common, this might be available to players as well.  

### Totally optional, but maybe fun:
* Miniatures to represent characters in combat.
* A deck of playing cards or tarot cards (just in case a card game breaks out).
* Props to illustrate circumstances on the battlefield.

## Rolling Dice
In general when you are asked to roll dice in Story Shaper, you will roll a pair of 10-sided dice. This gets you a range of 2 to 20, with results in the middle being significantly more likely than extreme results. You will then take the two dice, add the results together, and add a modifier to that which is based on your character’s character sheet (more on that later). The higher the result, the better you did at the task in question.  
There are instances where a different number of dice will be rolled, but all dice in S3 are 10-sided.

### Rerolls  
Some circumstances enable a player to reroll their dice. A given die can only be rerolled once, even if the new roll would otherwise qualify to be rerolled.

#### Boon
Circumstances or character traits sometimes grant a character an advantage that allows them to get favorable dice results in ways other than increasing their modifier. This is principally done by granting Boon +X. When a roll is made with Boon +X, the player may reroll one die if it is equal to or less than X. You must take the new roll, even if it is lower. 

> Some examples of Boon in play:  
> Varna makes a Stealth roll with Boon +3. He rolls two dice and gets a 2 and a 6. He chooses to reroll the 2, getting an 8, giving a final result of 6 + 8 = 14, plus his modifier.  
> Marona is trying to haggle at a shop with Boon +4. She rolls a 4 and a 9. She is allowed to keep this roll if she likes, but chooses to use the reroll and gets a 1. Her final result is 9 + 1 = 10 plus her modifier.

##### Boon Splitting
If a character's Boon magnitude matches or exceeds the sum of both dice, both may be rerolled. 

> For example, Billy Baggins is sniping an enemy, and has Boon 5. He rolls a 3 and a 1. His Boon level is higher than both dice combined, so he may reroll both. He gets a 9 and a 4, resulting in a much stronger hit.
> As a counter example, Jonny aims a gun and takes a shot that has Boon +2. He rolls his the dice and gets a 1 and a 2. This is not enough to reroll both dice, so he chooses to reroll the 1 and gets a 4. His final result of 2 + 4 = 6, plus any modifiers.

#### Bane
The unfavorable complement of Boon, Bane is imposed on a character when circumstances or sabotage make the character more likely to fail at a task. When a roll is made with Bane -X, the player must reroll their *highest* die if it is equal to or greater than (11 - X). Note that Bane does not go above -5, as rerolling any die below a 6 is statistically advantageous.

| Bane -X | Reroll a die above... |
|---------|-----------------------|
| -1      | 10                    |
| -2      | 9                     |
| -3      | 8                     |
| -4      | 7                     |
| -5      | 6                     |

Some examples of Bane in play:
* Adam is trying to follow tracks that have had some time to fade. This imposes Bane -3, meaning he must reroll any results over 8 (11 - 3). He rolls a 9 and a 1. Bane forces him to reroll the 9, which comes up as a 2. Final result is 1 + 2 = 3.
* XU-808 has Bane -4 on an attempt to repair a damaged mechanism with a Construct check due to them being on a ship that is currently engaged in chaotic combat. They must reroll any result above a 7. They roll a 7 and a 10. Because Bane specifies that one must reroll the higher die, the 10 is rerolled to a 3, for a final result of 7 + 3 = 10 plus any modifiers.

#### Combining Boon and Bane
If in a situation where Boon and Bane apply, they cancel each other out. Add their values and reroll based on the result. Some examples:
* Erin is attacking while affected by a blessing that gives her Boon +2, but is attacking an opponent who has a defensive spell that imposes Bane -1. Boon +2 and Bane -1 adds up to Boon +1, meaning she may reroll a die if she rolls a 1.
* Morris is attempting to pick a lock. He has picked these kinds of locks before on, so his familiariy gives him Boon +2 the check. However, his picks have been badly damaged in a way that, imposing Bane -3. Boon +2 and Bane -3 adds to Bane -1, meaning he must reroll a die if the roll is higher than 10.
* Arden is trying to leap over to a ledge. They have an item that augments their athletic ability with Boon +2, but a windstorm is making it harder with Bane -2. Boon +2 and Bane -2 adds to 0, so they will not have any opportunity or obligation to reroll dice.

#### Boon, Bane, and Multiple Targets  
When using a multi-target Ability, there may be situations where Boon or Bane applies to one or more targets in the effect but not others. (For example, one target may have a Curse on it that gives Boon to attackers while other affected by an ability do not.) In cases like this, resolve targets that are NOT affected by Boon or Bane effects first, then do appropriate Boon/Bane rerolls on the targets affected by Boon or Bane.

### Miscellaneous Rules  
Here are a few general rules prevent confusion.  

You count as your own ally. You can target yourself with anything that is listed to target allies.

When counting squares for movement or range, the count is orthogonal--i.e. excludes diagonal movements.

Round down during dice rolls. If you ever have a fraction, just cut off the fractional bit entirely. Even if your roll is (somehow?) 13.9, it rounds down to a 13.  

In combat, defenders win ties. For example, if using an offensive Ability results in the accuracy role matching the defender’s Defense, the Ability misses and the defender suffers no consequence.  

For a tie during opposed Skill checks (such as Empathy versus Deception, or Awareness versus Stealth), both characters reroll until there is no tie. Any Boon or Bane on the original rolls still apply when rerolling due to a tie.

# Chapter 2: Character Creation
Before you can begin playing a game of Story Shaper, you have to know who (or what) the persona you’re taking control of actually is, what they can do, and what they struggle with. You should also flesh that character out, make them a person, someone who belongs in an interesting story. In this section, we will go through the steps of building characters.  
The focus will be on how the character is represented in rules. Fleshing out a character in the context of how that person fits into the world, what the character looks like, the characters motivations and fears, and similar details should be an exercise mostly taken between the Arbiter and the player.

> Let's walk through the character creation process for two hypothetical characters to give an example as well as demonstrate a point.  
> 
> The first is being played by Eric. He joining his friends in a pulp sci-fi adventure, and he has decided he wants to play a robot. He names his character XU-808.
> 
> Meanwhile in another game, Lydia is setting up with her friends to play a classic fantasy setting, and she has decided that she'll be the party's spellcaster. She names her new character Marona.

## Step 1: Attributes
Each character’s general characteristics are represented by their “Attributes.” These are numbers that broadly represent the character’s capabilities. These add directly to at least two other secondary statistics and are added in when making certain Skill checks (more on both of these subjects later).  
A zero represents average human performance in that Attribute, and from there it can go positive or negative. Two or above represents a gifted individual, and above five indicates superhuman ability. Negative two or below indicates an impairment that has a significant effect on one’s life, and negative five and below represents difficulty so severe that one cannot get by day to day without assistance.  
Your Arbiter will tell you the rules on how you determine your Attributes. For a standard game, my recommendation is to give 6 points to spend, with a cap of 3 points into one attribute and the option to take a -1 in order to  get a 7th point. I recommend against randomizing Attribute generation.

There are six attributes: Strength, Finesse, Toughness, Mind, Heart, and Soul. 
* **Strength** represents both raw strength and one’s ability to utilize strength. High Strength may mean people ask your character to help move things for them a lot, or perhaps that they are on some kind of athletics team. They could be visibly muscular. Meanwhile, low Strength might result in the character being spindly or out of shape.
   * Strength is also added to your Hit Points and Physical Offense stats.
* **Finesse** represents how agile or dexterous your character is. High Finesse means that you would generally move with grace, or perhaps represents good aim or dexterity. Low Finesse might instead confer general clumsiness.
   * Finesse is also added to your Initiative, Physical offense, and Physical Defense stats.
* **Toughness** represents health and hardiness. A character with high Toughness may never seem to tire from physical activity or shrug off injuries with relative ease, while low Toughness might mean the character is sickly or bruises easily.
   * Toughness is also added to your Hit Points and Physical Defense stats.
* **Mind** represents intelligence and cleverness. A character with high Mind generally has a good memory, makes good grades if they put in the effort to do so, and is a great problem solver. Low Mind often means difficulty learning new technical concepts and a hard time remembering details.
   * Mind is also added to your Mental Points and Mental offense stats.
* **Heart** represents charisma and presence. Someone with high Heart is able to naturally be the center of attention or get people to do what they want, while someone with low Heart might naturally go unnoticed in social situations or just generally lack presence.
   * Heart is also added to your Mental Points and Mental Defense stats.
* **Soul** represents centeredness and perception. Someone with high Soul might not be religious but is likely very spiritual while also being good at reading people or noticing small details. Meanwhile someone with low Soul would generally have a difficult time with spiritual pursuits such as meditation and also have a general obliviousness to them.
   * Soul is also added to your Initiative, Mental offense, Mental Defense stats.
   
If you’re struggling to come up with your Attribute arrangement, here are a few recommendations that can help.

* Be careful about overspecialization. Most characters want to be particularly good at doing one thing, but if you leave your character unable to do anything else at all you may end up unable to contribute in some situations. For example, a hero who has a very high HP pool along with high Defense attributes is good, but if said hero has no means of dealing damage or drawing a foe’s attention, the enemy may just ignore the character. A character with tremendous MP and Mental offense may do a lot of damage, but if said character’s HP and Physical Defense is low then they may not last long enough to utilize said MP. You can’t be good at everything, but try to be decent at a few things. If you do choose to completely specialize in one approach, you should consider choosing Abilities that will let you overcome your weaknesses.
* If you have stats to spare and you’re not sure where they should go, consider investing them in Toughness. More HP and Defense is always beneficial.

> Eric considers XU-808's Attributes. His Arbiter has given him five points to work with. He reasons that his robot character should have high Mind to represent their ability to calculate quickly as well as a strong memory, so he puts their Mind to 3. Being made of metal instead of skin, he also figures XU-808 should be pretty tough as well, and adds the last 2 points to Toughness. He also has the option of taking a negative point, and reasons that his robot is relatively naive and logical in a way that makes them hard to relate to. He puts a negative point in Heart, and uses the extra point to increase his Toughness by one more step. After all this, XU-808's Attributes are Strength 0, Finesse 0, Toughness 3, Mind 3, Soul 0, Heart -1.
> 
> Lydia does the same thing for Marona, also with five points to distribute. She expects to be using a lot of spells, so she focuses in her Mind to get a lot of MP and Offense to work with. She sets her Mind to 3. She's also expecting a lot of combat in her game, so she wants to give her character the best chance to survive it. Looking over her options, she decides the best way to do this is to increase her HP, so she puts the rest of her points into Toughness. She decides she'd like to really focus on being sturdy, so she looks over her Attributes for one she can afford to drop. She decides that the right answer would be Heart. She has ulterior motives (which we'll talk about later) but decides to justify it by framing her character as being an academic who has spent more time with books than people, making her socially awkward. She adds the extra point to Toughness. Her final stats for her wizard are Strength 0, Finesse 0, Toughness 3, Mind 3, Soul 0, Heart -1.

## Step 2-a: HP/MP
After choosing your Attributes, you can determine your point stats.
* **Max HP:** HP stands for hit points or health points (both work), and they are an abstract representation of a character’s health. While the character still has HP, they can still press on. At character creation you gain fifteen plus your Strength times three plus your Toughness times three HP. [15 + (STR x 3) + (TGH x 3)] (See [Chapter 12](#chapter-12-health-injury-death-and-recovery) for a more thorough description of what HP represent.)
* **Max MP:** MP stats for mental points or mana points. While some Abilities spend HP, most require you to spend MP to use them. You start with fifteen plus your Mind times three plus your Heart times three. [15 + (MND x 3) + (HRT x 3)]
 
> Both XU-808 and Marona have to calculate their point stats now. For HP, their Strength is 0 and their Toughness is 3, so [15 + (0 * 3) + (3 * 3) = 24] is their starting HP. Mind 3 and Heart -1, so [15 + (3 * 3) + (3 * -1) = 21].

## Step 2-b: Offense/Defense/Initiative  
Offense modifies to your attacks’ effectiveness, Defense represents or your ability to mitigate a foe's attacks, and Initiative determines what order you act in combat.

#### Physical Offense
This broadly represents your ability to attack foes by mundane means. The better your Physical Offense, the more likely you are to successfully hit foes and do more damage with fists, melee weapons, and non-mental missile attacks. A high Physical Offense could imply great strength, well honed training, precise aim, and other such characteristics. You add your Strength and Finesse to Physical Offense.

> Our characters have Strength 0 and Finesse 0, so their starting Physical Offense is 0. Which is fine; they can simply create a character that doesn't use Physical Offense.

#### Mental Offense
This broadly represents your ability to manipulate energy, technology, or other non-physical forces to strike out at foes. High Mental Offense could imply an intense well of inner power to draw upon, better understanding of technology used to inflict harm on others, a connection to some external power source you channel to lash out at your enemies, or something similar. The term “mental” is here mainly to differentiate it from “physical” and could easily be adjusted to apply to technology, magic, psychic powers, natural weapons, or other such power sources. You add your Mind and Soul to Mental Offense.

> With Mind 3 and Soul 0, XU-808 and Marona have Mental Offense 3.

#### Physical Defense
This statistic represents your ability to mitigate mundane strikes sent against you. This could imply being quick enough to dodge attacks, tough enough to just ignore them, being equipped with armor or shields to protect you, or a combination of these effects. You start with 10 Physical Defense. You add your Toughness and Finesse to Physical Defense.

> Both characters have 3 Toughness and 0 Finesse, so their Physical Defense starts at 13.

#### Mental Defense
Mental Defense enables you to mitigate damage you would otherwise take from energy attacks. High Mental Defense can imply being trained in counterspells or arcane shielding techniques, understanding and utilizing equipment or technology that dampens or redirects energy directed at you, or just being so resilient that you can endure the attack without harm. You start with 10 Mental Defense. You add your Heart and Soul to Mental Defense.

> Both characters have Heart -1 and Soul 0. They start with Mental Defense at 9.

##### Defense Bonus
Some Abilities or effects sometimes use a value called "Defense Bonus." This can be Physical or Mental. This is just your total defense of the corresponding type without the base 10 everyone starts with. This value is mostly of concern to characters attempting to get some offensive value from their defensive stats. If the value in question is Physical Defense it will be listed as Physical Defense Bonus, while Mental Defense is listed as Mental Defense Bonus.

> So for XU-808 and Marona, their Physical Defense Bonus is 3 and their Mental Defense Bonus is -1.

#### Initiative Bonus
At the beginning of a dangerous encounter (usually but not always combat) you make an Initiative roll. This determines the order in which characters act. You add your Finesse and Soul to Initiative rolls.

Initiative can also be used to determine who reacts first in an out-of-combat context. If characters are ever attempting to do something at the same time and the order of actions is important, have all parties roll Initiative; whoever rolls the highest is the first to act.

> Marona and XU-808 have Finesse 0 and Soul 0, so their Initiative is 0.

## Step 3: Abilities
The next step is to choose Abilities. [Chapter 4](#chapter-4-abilities) goes into greater detail on what an Ability actually entails. In short, an Ability represents a maneuver that characters can utilize in combat. These will define your role when you’re fighting. When a character is created, they know 3 Abilities (two + one gained from being Level 1) for free as well as all Tier 0 Abilities.

Some advice if you are having trouble choosing your Abilities:
* If you don’t have a better plan, you should have at least one Ability that fits within your character’s intended skill set. Your Strength dominant hero should have at least one melee attack. A Mind/Soul dominant hero is going to want mental attacks.
* That said, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If all of your attacks are melee range then an enemy who attacks from a distance will be a severe problem for you. If you have nothing but healing or support Abilities, then you will be helpless if you get separated from your allies. Once you have your core covered you might add some variety to your arsenal.
* At first your HP and MP pool will be limited. Keep costs in mind when picking Abilities. If an Ability requires too much of your MP to use often, maybe it’s not a good choice.
* It is wise to choose at least one Ability that requires a Minor Action to use. Doing so allows you to increase your effectiveness by letting you more consistently use both of your Actions. (More on Actions in [Chapter 10](#chapter-10-combat))

> Eric considers what kind of things XU-808 should be able to do in fights. He likes the idea of a lightning ray, so XU-808 starts with the Elemental Lance Ability, taking the Sky version. He also wants XU-808 to be able to scan enemy shields, so he takes Scan. Finally, he wants a cloaking device, so he takes Vanish as his final starting Ability.
>
> Meanwhile Lydia considers her Abilities. She wants Scan because she wants to hit enemy weak points, and she wants a way to escape bad situations so she takes Vanish. She needs a way to deal damage too. She decides to start her build off using electric damage and so she picks Elemental Lance with Sky.

## Step 4: Skills
Next, you will distribute Skill Points. There’s more information on Skills in [Chapter 6](#chapter-6-Skills), but the general idea is that skills are things that your character is generally good at aside from combat. Each skill has two Attributes added to their modifier, and you can use skill points to increase your base modifiers. Each skill can have skill points equal to your Level + 3 allocated. (So if you’re making a new character, you can spend at most 4 points per skill.) Skills will most often be utilized outside of combat, though certain enemies or Abilities may bring some to play during combat. You start with 20 skill points at character creation.

Here are some things to consider when distributing skill points:
* Skills are the portion of character creation most closely tied to roleplaying. Other aspects of the system have been intentionally divorced from having an impact on roleplay, but you should choose skills that make sense for your character to have.
* If you’re satisfied with your character’s representation but still have skill points remaining, consider coordinating with the other players. A given party would typically benefit from having all of their bases covered.
* If you’ve done the above and still have skill points, then consider increasing Athletics, Acrobatics, Awareness, Composure, Empathy, or Endure. These skills are either universally useful, reactive in nature, or may benefit the party to have multiple members able to use them well.

> Eric considers XU-808's Skills. Going down the list, he first spots Composure. Eric likes the idea of high Composure representing his robot being difficult to rattle emotionally. He decides for simplicity to just max things out as he chooses them, so he puts 4 points into Composure. Next he spots Endure--pain tolerance, going without food, his robot should be good at that too. 4 points in Endure. The next two skills that catch his interest are Investigation and Science. He decides that XU-808's primary function is as a researcher, and puts those two skills to maximum.
> 
> Meanwhile Lydia thinks about what Marona should able able to do. Like Eric, she decides to just max four Skills. Lore, obviously, a Wizard needs to know magic stuff. She knows her Arbiter likes to throw in a lot of horror elements, so she figures Composure will be useful. She also likes the idea of Investigation, better to find new spells with. And finally in previous games she remembers having a few hard Endure checks, so she decides to put her last points into Endure.
> 
> After adding in Attributes, the two characters have the following Skill checks:
> 
> Composure +7, Endure +6, Investigation +7, Lore +7 (Marona), Science +7 (XU-808)  
> 
> All their other skills are done just with their Attributes.

## Step 5: Elemental Properties
In settings where elemental magic is common, characters can start with a weakness to one element and a resistance to one other. The available elements are Fire, Ice, Sky, Earth, Light, and Dark.
Elemental properties are not appropriate for all settings or all characters. Consult your Arbiter on whether you should do this for your character when creating them.  
When receiving damage in an element a combatant is weak to, the attacker rolls three dice and drops the **lowest** die to calculate the damage done. When receiving damage in an element a combatant is resistant to, the attacker rolls three dice and drops the **highest** die.  
When striking multiple targets with different elemental properties (such as with an area of effect), first resolve all targets that are neither resistant nor weak to the element by rolling two ten-siders as normal. After that, roll an additional die, then apply the highest two against foes weak to your chosen element and the lowest two against resistant foes.  
Extra dice rolled this way are affected by Boon and Bane normally. If you have to roll dice in two phases (as described in the previous paragraph), Boon or Bane triggered during the first phase (against elementally neutral targets) cannot reroll the die rolled during the second phase.

> For example, Anezka is using the Elemental Blast Ability with Ice element against a target that is weak to Ice along with two targets that are neutral toward Ice. She also has Boon 4. To damage the two neutral opponents, she rolls the normal two dice, getting a 9 and a 4. She rerolls the 4 and gets a 1 (Boon backfires sometimes), so her final die result is 9 + 1 + her Mental Offense.  
> She now targets the Ice-weak target by rolling a third die, getting a 3. Since she used Boon to reroll the 4 earlier, she cannot reroll the 3. She still drops the lowest two dice, so for this foe her final result is 9 + 3 + her Mental Offense.

## Step 6: Talent
Finally, you choose one talent. Talents are described in full in [Chapter 9](#chapter-9-talents); these are major changes that help define what your character is good at.  

> Eric looks over the available Talents for something that looks interesting. He spots Sturdy Shield and decides that could represent XU-808 having energy shields.  
> 
> Meanwhile Lydia looked ahead to plan her build. Since she took a point away in Heart, she decides to use Sturdy Shield to cover her weak Mental Defense.  
>
> In both cases, this means that their Mental Defense goes from 9 to 13.  

## Step 7: Starting items
> Currently there are no rules for items or equipment in this game. The Arbiter is free to make up magical or technological items where it suits. In general, basic equipment is not tracked in this game. Axes and swords don't have different stats. A character should start with their most essential items (weapons, armor, tools) assumed to be part of their kit. The basic idea is that characters in S3 are distinguished by what they can do, not what kind of gear they have. If you're playing a character with high strength, they can start with appropriate weapons. If your character is a mage, they can start with any implements they need to use their magic. If you're playing a very sturdy character, they could start with armor. Having the Shoot Ability implies the presence of a bow, gun, crossbow, throwing spears, or something similar.

> Note that steps 8 and 9 can be skipped while still ending with a working character. If this is your first time trying S3 and you want to get straight into it, you can skip these steps, and with them skip reading chapters 7 and 8. This will let you get a taste of the system without committing to reading every word of this book. If you play for a while and find you like the system, you can come back to these steps. You should still do step 9 because of the significant effect is has on your character's performance.

## Step 8: Lesson  
Next you choose one Lesson. Lessons represent a character specializing in specific abilities or fighting styles in the form of passive or conditional bonuses. Lessons are listed in [Chapter 7](#chapter-7-lessons). 

> XU-808's sheet is nearly complete. After looking over the options, Eric decides to take the Superior Scanner Lesson, reasoning it could represent being built with advanced scanning equipment.
>
> Meanwhile Lydia takes the same Lesson because she expects to be using Scan to find enemy weaknesses a lot and wants to get as much as she can out of said actions.

## Step 9: Utility
Next, you choose one Utility. Utilities represent non-combat specializations, giving you a boost to certain Skills or a new option that gives the character broader capabilities off the battlefield. You may only choose a Utility with the standard 3 XP cost; Utilities that cost additional XP cannot be taken as your free Utility. Utilities are listed in [Chapter 8](#chapter-8-utilities)   

> Eric decides Eidetic Memory is an easy choice to represent XU-808's computer having perfect memory.
>
> Meanwhile Lidia just likes being able to ask the Arbiter to fill in occasional gaps in her memory, so she takes the Eidetic Memory Utility to give an explanation on how she keeps all those details in her head.

------------
# Chapter 3: Improving your character
Rather than progressing in a class, heroes become stronger by spending experience points (XP). This will allow you to choose between a highly specialized character with a small number of very effective abilities, or a character that has many different tools, making them more likely to have exactly what is needed for a given situation.

> XU-808 and Marona start the game with nearly identical sheets. However, as they level up they begin to diverge in specialized ways.

## Gaining XP
This section will focus on how the party gains XP, and is mostly of concern to Arbiters.

The rate at which characters grow in power is, in the end, a matter of taste. There is never going to be an optimal way to schedule out how characters grow. There are no set rules on this.

> There are, however, recommendations I can give based on the results of my play testing. These are boxed because I'm going to be speaking in first person and from experience as an Arbiter rather than as a game designer.  
> In general, my recommendation is that a typical session that moves the plot forward gives the players 1 XP. This allows for slow, steady growth that you can reasonably keep on top of as an Arbiter. Sessions that involve a higher amount of risk or danger should give more XP, but not a ton more. I would say the completion of a story arc would merit 5 XP. Other sessions would fall somewhere between those two extremes.  
> Note that this does not only apply to overcoming physical danger. A tense negotiation might result in XP as much as a combat encounter.    
> If you go too slowly, players may come to feel stagnant or under-rewarded. Giving too much XP too quickly makes it more difficult to design suitable encounters for the players; if the player characters' strengths increase substantially session to session then you're at greater risk of substantially under or over estimating what makes for a good fight. Either of those results can be a disaster.   
> My play-testers all agreed that they'd prefer they all have the same XP. Other groups might disagree; it might be that players who don't show up don't gain XP, or perhaps the Arbiter might like to give bonus XP for helping to run the game. Discuss this with the group before you begin playing.  
> I strongly recommend against giving role-playing XP. If the players don't want to role-play, that's fine; run a dungeon delving group. Role-play is supposed to be for its own sake.  

## Spending XP
Between sessions, you can allocate your XP to buy from the benefits listed in this section. Keep up with what XP was spent in what way on your character sheet.

If you're looking specifically for the XP cost of specific benefits, refer to this cheat sheet.

| Benefit                 | XP Cost                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Level up                | 4 + current Level         |
| Vitality/Capacity       | 3                         |
| Physical/Mental Attack  | 4                         |
| Physical/Mental Defense | 3                         |
| Initiative              | 1                         |
| 4 Skill Points          | 1                         |
| Tier 1 Ability          | 3                         |
| Tier 2 Ability          | 5                         |
| Lessons                 | 5 unless otherwise stated |
| Utilities               | 3 unless otherwise stated |

> An Arbiter might also give explicit moments in the middle of a session to spend XP when it suits the narrative. For example, if a character is put into a situation where they are actively training in a skill an Arbiter might give the character the opportunity to buy skill points or stat improvements related to that training.

### Level
While there are no set classes, heroes do gain Levels. Their Level acts as a cap on certain values; multiple benefits that one can spend XP on can only go up to the hero’s Level. Increasing a character’s Level represents a general increase in competence and potential. A character’s Level limits the following:
* Every Level increases the number of times [Vitality and Capacity](#vitalitycapacity) can be purchased
* The hero’s Base Physical Offense, Physical Defense, Mental Offense, Mental Defense, and Initiative Bonus can be increased a number of times up to the character’s Level

In addition, purchasing a Level gives its own benefit that goes in a five Level loop. These benefits do not cost additional XP.
* At Levels 1, 6, 11, … the character gains an Ability of any tier they could normally learn. 
* At Levels 2, 7, 12, … the character gains one point in Vitality or Capacity.
* At Level 3, 8, 13, … the character increases their Physical or Mental Defense and any one of their Attributes by 1.
* At Levels 4, 9, 14, … the character increases their Physical or Mental Offense.
* At Level 5, 10, 15, … the character gains a Talent (more on Talents in [Chapter 9](#chapter-9-talents)).

> You can think of your character's Level representing their potential. Gaining a Level would represent pushing through the plateaus and putting in the work that come with developing, whether as a warrior, mage, diplomat, spy, or anything you care to create. That could represent training or practice in the background, taking a class on the side, or just getting better with experience.  
> It might be good to have a plan about when to increase your Level. XU-808 is mostly interested in Skills, and so Levels up when their skills are all maxed out for a given Level, choosing combat stats only when they feel it necessary. 
> Meanwhile Marona generally Levels up when she's taken Magic Attack, Vitality, and Capacity to the maximum her Level allows.

Characters start at Level 1 (and therefore gain one free Ability in addition to the two they start with). Level 2 costs 5 XP, and each subsequent Level costs (4 + their current Level) XP. So Level 3 costs 6 XP, Level 4 costs 7 XP, and so on.

> Sidenote \<Milestone Levels>: Instead of allowing players to purchase Levels, the Arbiter may instead choose to declare that all characters Level up at certain milestones. While this does constrain players, it also ensures a given party will have fairly similar power ranges. This makes it easier to balance combat encounters while also making milestones feel more impactful.

#### Hero Tier
Hero Tier is a value that broadly represents your character's power. You start at Hero Tier 1, and every five Levels after the first (6, 11, 16, …) increases this value. Hero Tier is used to scale many facets of your character. 

> Increasing in Hero Tier represents a significant increase in competence and invites participation in more consequential events. 

### Vitality/Capacity
Purchasing Vitality increases your hero’s maximum HP by 5 + their Strength + their Toughness. Purchasing Capacity increases your hero’s maximum MP by 5 + their Mind + their Heart. Both of these can be purchased multiple times, up to your character’s [Level](#level). Vitality and Capacity upgrades cost 3 XP.

> Both XU-808 and Marona need HP and MP, so they both take Vitality and Capacity levels occasionally.

### Base Physical/Mental Offense/Defense
Every character has a base bonus to their Physical and Mental Offense and Defense. It starts at zero, but each category can be increased up to the hero’s [Level](#level). Increasing Physical or Mental Offense costs 4 XP, and increasing Physical or Mental Defense costs 3 XP.

> Marona's primary role in her party is to deal damage, so she spends most of her effort on Base Mental Offense. Meanwhile XU-808 has ended up the most sturdy character in their game, so to extend this advantage they take base Physical and Mental Defense as a priority.

### Base Initiative  
Like with Offense and Defense, character have a base bonus to their Initiative rolls. It starts at zero and can be increased up to the character's level. Increasing base Initiative costs 1 XP.

### Skill Points
You may spend 1 XP to gain 4 skill points. The maximum number of points you can put into any skill is 3 + your [Level](#level).

> Marona is in an action packed game where danger is everywhere. She quickly finds that she can use points in Awareness, Sabotage, and Stealth.
> 
> Meanwhile XU-808 is in a much more social game where solutions are usually negotiated rather than fought over. They reason that the adaptive AI that XU-808 runs on would learn Diplomacy. They also like the idea of self modifying their chassis, so they take Construct and Tech to represent that capability.

### Abilities
Abilities represent things you can actively do, typically in combat. These can come from training in elaborate techniques, learning spells, building equipment, natural biology, or whatever justification is suitable for a given hero being able to do something.

Abilities come in two tiers. You may only purchase Abilities from tiers less than or equal to your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier). They cost 1 + (2 \* their tier) XP. So 3 for tier 1, 5 for tier 2.

Abilities are described in more detail in [Chapter 4](#chapter-4-abilities) and listed individually in [Chapter 5](#chapter-5-list-of-abilities).

> In XU-808's game, they ended up the sturdiest character in the party. They decide to focus on this, taking Abilities like Guard and Protector's Presence to defend their allies during combat.
> 
> Meanwhile in Marona's game, there is another player who intentionally and actively built their character to be the party's defender, leaving Marona room to focus on offense. For example, she takes the Elemental Blast Ability to deal with crowds.

### Lessons
Lessons represent passive abilities. These generally modify rolls, giving benefits when certain conditions are met. They offer notable benefits when using certain types of Abilities or grant a benefit in some conditions. Lessons cost 5 XP unless an exception is listed.

Lessons are described in more detail in [Chapter 7](#chapter-7-lessons).

> Marona wants to focus on elemental Abilities, so she takes the Elemental Attunement Lesson several times. By the time she's done she can deal Fire, Ice, Sky, and Earth damage. (Another player in her game focuses on dealing Dark damage, so she decides to save the XP needed to unlock it.) Once done with that, she also takes the Advantageous Recovery Lesson so that she gets extra benefits when striking a foe's elemental weakness.
> 
> Meanwhile XU-808 is spending most of their XP on other aspects of their character. They decide that the Resilient Protector Lesson is enough to represent XU-808's sturdiness in combat.  

### Talents
Talents represent significantly more impactful modifications to your character’s abilities. They either apply more broadly or have much higher influence than Lessons, and as such they are only available at first [Level](#level), and then when you reach a Level divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15…). They have no cost to purchase.

Talents are described in more detail in [Chapter 9](#chapter-9-talents).

> Upon reaching 5th level, XU-808 immediately decides to pick the Flight talent, adding a jetpack to their arsenal.
> 
> Meanwhile Marona wants more mobility in her build. Looking over the Talents, she decides to take Overwhelming Force, allowing her to add her Toughness to her Mental Offense, significantly boosting her damage output.

### Utilities
Utilities represent non-combat abilities that aid an adventurer. These may influence Skill rolls, or grant new options for a given hero. There is no limit on the number of Utilities a given character may purchase, and the XP cost for each Utility is listed in its entry.

Utilities are described in more detail in [Chapter 8](#chapter-8-utilities).

> XU-808 starts picking up Utilities with Asceticism, reasoning that its benefits align with things a machine should be able to do anyway. Eidetic Memory also helps represent the capabilities of a computer based mind.
> 
> Marona spends a lot of time delving in dungeons, and decides to take some Utilities to help in those situations. She starts with Speak with the Ancient Dead, allowing her to interrogate any corpses they find in their adventures. She also takes Whispered Wisdom so she can provide the party with extra information with her Lore check.

------------
# Chapter 4: Abilities
Abilities represent powers or moves your character is able to do, usually in combat. When you first create a character they start with three Abilities. Additional abilities are purchased for XP. Abilities come in two tiers (currently), with each tier being more powerful and costly than the previous. You must reach [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) 2 to purchase Tier 2 Abilities.
  
> <div align="center">=!=!=DISCLAIMER=!=!=</div>
> <div align="center">The following section uses some terms defined in <a href="https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md#chapter-10-combat">Chapter 10</a>. This handbook is laid out to keep everything you need to know about character creation in sequence. If you want to check on details such as how movement and spacing work, you may want to skip ahead using the link above.</div>

> <div align="center">=!=!=!=!=  </div>

## Reading Abilities
Ability entries will follow this basic layout:

**The Name of the Ability**  
Ability Type (Attack/Spell/Auxiliary)  
Action (Major/Minor/Counter): whether the Ability requires a Minor, Major, or Counter Action to use.  
Prerequisites: What other things are required before one can learn this Ability.  
Range: How far away a target can be while still being in reach of this Ability. There are five possible ranges:  
* None - targets yourself.
* Melee - targets in the same Square as you.
* Short - can be used on targets up to 1 Square away.
* Medium - targets enemies up to 3 Squares away.
* Long - targets enemies up to 5 Squares away.  
* Extreme - targets enemies up to 8 Squares away.  

Targets: Who or what this Ability targets.  
Cost: The HP or MP cost of this Ability.  
Damage: When using this Ability to do damage, multiply your [Impact](#impact) by this number to determine the amount.  
Effect: Things particular to a given Ability.  
Description: A general overview of what a given Ability might represent from a roleplaying perspective.  

## Prerequisites
Sometimes an Ability has a prerequisite listed in its entry. This means that you must fulfill the listed conditions before you are allowed to take that Ability. Generally this will be another Ability, often representing related skills building off of each other. There are other things that could be prerequisites, such as Skills, as well. If at any time you no longer fulfill the prerequisites for a given Ability, you can no longer use it.

## Ability Types
There are three types of Abilities.
* **Attack** means that the Ability uses Physical Accuracy and is resisted by Physical Defense.
* **Spell** means that the Ability uses Mental Accuracy and is resisted by Mental Defense. 
   * Note that just because the term used here is “spell” the Ability does not have to represent magical actions. The effect could be produced by technology, alchemy, bizzare anatomy, or some other thing.
* **Auxiliary** Abilities do not use offense rolls. They generally target yourself or your allies.
   
## Ability Series
Some Abilities are part of a series, building off each other and using each other as prerequisites. A quick explanation of each follows:
* **Augment** - Auxiliary abilities that empower allies.
* **Curse** - Auxiliary abilities that weaken foes.
* **Elemental** - Abilities which deal damage through one of the elements. Striking an opponent with an element they are weak to allows you to roll three dice during your offense roll, taking the higher of the two results. When striking an opponent with an element they resist, you roll three dice again but take the lower two results. The six elements are:
   * *Fire* - heat and flames
   * *Ice* - sharp icicles and freezing cold
   * *Earth* - shards of rock, acid, and plant vines
   * *Sky* - electricity, wind blades, and the like
   * *Light* - radiance, blinding light, and holy power
   * *Dark* - Destroying life essence, sharpened shadows, or unholy power
* **Healing** - Abilities that focus on restoring and rejuvenating allies. This can be by magically mending wounds, quickly bandaging cuts, singing a song that restores their spirits, or recharging their shields.

## Ability Keywords
Some specific terms come with Abilities. These can be effects that Abilities confer on you, or things that change how you use the Abilities themselves. Here are their definitions:

### Careful
An Ability that normally only uses the listed Major or Minor Action, but that is improved if you also use your second Action on it, representing taking the time to do it right.

### Cooldown
An Ability or Lesson with a Cooldown cannot be used again for the listed duration. Cooldowns decrease by 1 at [Round Start](#round-start).

### Upkeep
Any Ability with an Upkeep in its cost requires the given cost to be paid at [Round Start](#round-start). As long as the Upkeep is paid, the Ability has no duration. If the user is unable or unwilling to pay the Upkeep cost at Round Start, the Ability immediately ends. (To clarify; the listed cost is paid when the action starting it is taken, and the Upkeep cost is paid on all subsequent rounds.)  

## Buff Tracks
These are a way of measuring advantage or disadvantage in Offense or Defense. Unless you are in conditions that specify otherwise, you start every combat at level 0 in both tracks. Several different Abilities can affect this track, which provides appropriate benefits or downsides to every character in a unified way.

#### The Offensive Track
* **Level 3** - You make Offense rolls at Boon +4, and your Mental and Physical Offense increase by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).
* **Level 2** - You make Offense rolls at Boon +3, and your Abilities that require Offense rolls cost 1 less HP or MP per Hero Tier. This cannot take an Ability’s cost below 1.
* **Level 1** - You make Offense rolls at Boon +2.
* **Level 0** - Normal, no changes.
* **Level -1** - You make Offense rolls at Bane -2.
* **Level -2** - You make Offense rolls at Bane -3, and your Abilities that require Offense rolls cost 1 more HP or MP per Hero Tier. 
* **Level -3** - You make Offense rolls at Bane -4, and your Mental and Physical Offense decreases by your Hero Tier.

#### The Defensive Track
* **Level 3** - Offense rolls made against you have Bane -4, and your Mental and Physical Defense increases by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).
* **Level 2** - Offense rolls made against you have Bane -3, and you gain [Shield](#shield-x) equal to twice your Hero Tier at the start of your Turn.
* **Level 1** - Offense rolls made against you have Bane -2.
* **Level 0** - Normal, no changes.
* **Level -1** - Offense rolls against you have Boon +2.
* **Level -2** - Offense rolls against you have Boon +3, and you cannot gain Shield.
* **Level -3** - Offense rolls against you have Boon +4, and your Mental and Physical Defense decreases by your Hero Tier.

### Duration  
Negative levels on the Buff Tracks have no duration, and must be removed via [Recover](#recover) or similar measures.  
Positive values begin decaying once every 3 rounds. Recieving another increase along the Buff Track resets this timer. Once a buff track begins decaying, its level decreases at every [Round Start](#round-start).

> For example, Cyrick casts [Fortify](#fortify) on himself in round 1 on combat. If he does not gain another boost in his Defense Track by round 4, his Defense Buff begins decaying. On round 3, he uses [Hold Fast](#hold-fast), boosting his Defense Buff to level 2 and resetting the decay timer to round round 6. At round 6's start, Cyrick's Defense Track decreases to 1. If he does not recieve another defense buff by roun 7's start, the track will decay to 0.

# Chapter 5: List of Abilities

## Tier 0
Note: You automatically know all Tier 0 abilities.   
There may be other basic actions that an untrained character would be able to perform. Players may request new abilities of this power level if something they want to do is not represented here. These should not be taken as a straitjacket.

If you have been grabbed by someone, you cannot move. The person grabbing you can also cover your mouth to silence you if they wish.  
Description: An untrained attempt to hold on to your target.

Auxiliary  
Action: Minor or Major (See Effect)  
Prerequisites: None  
Range: None  
Targets: Self  
Cost: 1 MP  
Effect: Choose another Ability and state some conditions. When the conditions are fulfilled, you use this Ability on the target you specify. For example, you could Prepare your Elemental Lance Ability, and specify that it goes off if anyone tries to get closer to you. When you use the Prepared Ability, you must pay its cost as normal. You may choose not to take your Prepared action if an undesired target fulfills the condition. You remain Prepared until you take another action. If you take another action while Prepared, you lose the prepared action but are refunded the 1 MP cost of Prepare.  
This Ability's Action is the same as the chosen Ability you are Preparing.

# Chapter 6: Skills
Skills represent what your character is good at more broadly than Abilities. Skills are general purpose things and are usually rolled outside of combat (though they may come up in combat at times).  

Skill checks should only occur when there is some sort of pressure or danger present in a situation, or if the action being attempted is of non-trivial difficulty. For example, the Arbiter generally should not call for a Skill check to do something as trivial as climbing a ladder. However, if you're rushed, being attacked, the ladder is damaged and unstable, or under similar duress, you will need a Skill check. Doing something inherently dangerous, such as trying to climb a sheer cliff face, also requires a Skill check. For all of these examples, these checks would be a combination of Athletics, Acrobatics, with occasional Endure checks.  
Skills can also be used to answer questions about a related subject. For example, if you needed to know how much weight a pillar can bear, you can make a Construct check. To identify a song being played by someone else, roll a Performance check. To know the correct greeting in a formal situation in an unfamiliar land, make a Diplomacy check. To estimate the value of a pocket watch or a cut jewel you’ve found, make a Craft check.   

| Target number | Skill level          |
|---------------|----------------------|
| 5             | Trivial              |
| 10            | Easy                 |
| 15            | Moderately difficult |
| 20            | Very difficult       |
| 30            | Exceptional          |

## Skill Attributes
Each Skill has two associated Attributes. All skills of that type add those two Attributes to those Skill checks.  

## Skill Points  
You can spend Skill Points on each skill to raise its Base Bonus by 1. You start the game with 20 Skill Points to spend, and can purchase 5 Skill Points for 1 XP.  
The maximum number of Skill Points that can be invested into any one Skill is equal to your [Level](#level) + 3.  

### Helping Others
In situations where others need help with a skill you are well trained in, you can make the roll in their place. When you do this, you roll with half of your modifier. The character you are helping then treats that result as their own. Note that it is not always possible to help others with their checks.

### Raising the Stakes
You may choose to raise the target of a Skill check in order to get better results. If you do this, you fail the check if you don't meet the increased target, *even if you would have met the unaltered target*.  

Here are a few examples of modifications you can make. You and the Arbiter are encouraged to improvise additional possibilities.  

| Extra Effect            | Target Increase |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Look cool               | +1              |
| Use 25% fewer materials | +2              |
| Go 25% faster           | +3              |
| Get a superior result   | +5              |
| Look *extremely* cool   | +7              |

> Some examples:  
> Balam is climbing a rope ladder in a storm. The Athletics/Acrobatics target is 15. He wants to do it extra fast, so the Arbiter lets him increase that to 18.    
> Dr. Skren is working on a cybernetic arm for a friend. Normally this tech requires a Science or Tech check of 20, but she wants this to be extra powerful and cranks that target up to 25. If it works she gets a hell of an arm, but on failure the materials and time are wasted.

# Chapter 7: Lessons
Broadly speaking, Lessons represent passive combat benefits or extra options available to someone trained in specific style of combat. Some Lessons will list prerequisites; if that is the case then you must meet these prerequisites to be able to take the Lesson, and if you ever fail to meet those prerequisites you gain no benefit from the associated Lesson.  
Lessons cost 5 XP unless an exception is listed.

#### A Curse Most Foul  
When using a Curse Ability, you may choose one or both of the following benefits.
* If the Curse costs HP, you may spend MP instead. If it costs MP, you may spend HP instead.
* The victim of your Curse also takes damage equal to half of your [Offense](#step-2-b-offensedefense). Use Physical Offense if the Ability is an Attack, or Mental Offense if the Ability is a Spell.

> Reminder: all fractions round down. If your Offense is 5, then you add 2 damage when using the section benefit.

#### Ability Specialist  
Choose one Ability you already know. When you use that Ability, you may gain one of the following benefits:  
* Increase the Ability's Range by one increment. (So Melee Range becomes Short, Short becomes Medium, etc. Abilities that are already Extreme Range cannot use this benefit.)  
* Reduce the cost of the Ability (whether HP or MP) by your Hero Tier. This only applies to initial costs; this has no effect on Upkeep.  
* If the Ability is an Attack or Spell, you gain Boon 2 on Offense rolls with it.  

You choose which benefit you gain every time you use the Ability and may choose different benefits on different rounds.  
You may take this Lesson once per Hero Tier, choosing a different Ability each time.  

#### Advantageous Recovery  
When you strike a foe’s elemental weakness, you regain MP equal to half your [Base  Magic Offense](#base-physicalmental-offensedefense), up to a maximum equal to the MP used to perform the striking Ability. This Lesson can only be activated once per Ability use; striking multiple foes with one Ability cannot restore HP or MP more than once.

#### Aggressive Provocation  
When you target an opponent you have [Provoked](#provoke) with an Attack or Spell, you may use your Physical [Defense Bonus](#defense-bonus) in place of your Physical Offense, or Mental Defense Bonus in place of your Mental Offense.

#### Anger  
Whenever you receive damage you may enter an Enraged state. Spending HP to use an Ability or any effect described as “lose life” (such as losing HP due to low Endurance during a chase) does not count as damage. Damage from any source can activate Anger. While Enraged, your Physical and Mental Offense increases by 2, but your Physical and Mental Defense decreases by 3. If you end your Turn without having received damage since the end of your previous Turn, you are no longer Enraged.

#### Ataraxia  
Prerequisite: [Brace](#brace)  
While [rooted](#root), you may reduce the MP cost of any Spells you cast by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) (to a minimum of 0).

#### Combo Striker
Every time you successfully hit an opponent with a Melee or Short range Attack, you gain one Combo point. Each Combo point gives you Boon +1 on subsequent Attacks, to a maximum of your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) plus 1. If you miss with an Attack, change targets, or fail to use a Short or Melee range Attack on your current target, you lose all Combo points.

#### Curse Resistant  
Curse Abilities that target you do so at Bane -2.

#### Elemental Attunement  
When you gain this Lesson, pick one of the following: Fire, Cold, Sky, Earth, Light, or Dark. Whenever you use an Ability with the [Elemental] tag, you may chose to deal damage of the corresponding type.  
Special: You may take this Lesson more than once, choosing a different element each time. The first time you gain an Ability with the [Elemental] tag, you also automatically gain Elemental Attunement for free once.  
Every instance of this Lesson costs 3 XP.

#### First to Act  
Increase your [Initiative bonus](#initiative-bonus) by twice your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier). You also gain Boon +2 on Initiative rolls.

#### Fortifying Voice  
When you target creatures with an Augment, all affected gain [Shield](#shield-x) equal to your Mental [Defense Bonus](#defense-bonus).

#### Hit and Run  
Once per Turn when you use a melee range Attack, you can move 1 Square as part of the Attack. You can do this before or after making the Attack. This Lesson has [Cooldown](#cooldown) 3.

#### Improved Healing  
When casting a Healing Ability, you may roll an additional die. Remove the lowest die from your total result.

#### Lingering Provocation  
Any time you [Provoke](#provoke) a target, that Provocation lasts for 2 rounds.

#### Manamaim
Whenever you spend MP to cast a damaging Spell, you may increase the MP cost by the Spell's tier. If you do, add your [Capacity](#vitalitycapacity) to your damage. This extra damage is not included in multipliers.

> Example: Merlin has the Manamaim Lesson, Capacity 4, and casts Elemental Lance with the Overload cost. His opponent has Mental Defense 12, and his Offense total is 17. The [Impact](#impact) is 5, and with the Overload cost paid Elemental Lance has a x2 multiplier. This results in 10 damage, plus 4 from Manamaim, resulting in 14 damage.

#### Manamend
Whenever us an Ability that heals HP damage, you may increase the MP cost by the Ability's tier. If you do, add your [Capacity](#vitalitycapacity) to the total healing done.

#### Masochism  
Any time you spend HP to use an Attack or Spell, you gain [Shield](#shield-x) equal to the spent health that lasts until your next Turn.

#### Overcharge  
If your healing would bring your target above maximum HP, the target gains [Shield](#shield-x) to the excess. Targets can only have one Shield from this Lesson; if a larger Shield would be applied by this Lesson, the smaller one fades immediately. The Shield also fades at the start of your next Turn.

#### Oppressor  
When you knock a foe [Prone](#prone), they are not able to stand again if you are in the same Square as them. The effect lasts one round per [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).

#### Quick Healer  
Once per round, increase any HP restoration you receive by half. 

#### Relentless  
When you successfully strike with an Ability that forces a target to move, you gain the following benefits.  
* You may automatically move toward the target as many spaces as you forced them to move. If you forced multiple targets to move, choose one to follow.
* Your target is [Rooted](#root) until your next Turn.

#### Resilient Protector  
While you have [Taunt](#taunt) and are in the same space as an ally, are providing an ally with [Protection](#protection), or are being targeted by an opponent you have [Provoked](#provoke), increase your Physical and Mental Defense by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier). This benefit does not apply when using your Defense in place of an Offense roll, such as when using [Demand](#demand).

#### Sadism  
When you kill or knock out a foe, increase your [Offensive Track](#the-offensive-track) by 1. Alternatively, you may become [Charged](#charged)

#### Spell Sniper  
Prerequisite: [Brace](#brace)  
While [Rooted](#root), the range of any spell you cast increases by one Square.

#### Spell Strike  
If you successfully strike with an Attack Ability with your Major Action, you may use a Tier 1 Spell Ability that normally requires a Major Action as a Minor Action.  
If you successfully strike with a Spell Ability with your Major Action, you may use a Tier 1 Attack Ability that normally requires a Major Action as a Minor Action.

#### Superior Scanner  
When you use a Scan Ability, choose one of the following benefits.
* You automatically scan Squares instead of individuals, simultaneously learning about all creatures in that Square as well as checking for invisible creatures and objects in that Square.
* You learn the target’s Physical and Mental Attack in addition to the usual stats.
* You gain Boon +4 on the Stealth or Deception roll to conceal your use of the Scan Ability from your target.

#### Sustaining Upkeep  
When you pay an Upkeep cost in MP, you heal for that much HP.

------------
# Chapter 8: Utilities
Broadly, Utilities are things your character can do that are not related to combat. There is no limit to the number of Utilities a character can have. Unless otherwise stated, Utilities cost 3 XP. 
 
## Skill-based Utilities
> Note: the skill bonuses on these skill-based Utilities are NOT [Skill Points](#skill-points) and are added ON TOP OF the character's Base Skill Bonus.  
> For example, Elaahni wants to maximize her [Empathy](#empathy) checks. She is [Level](#level) 6, and has Heart 2 and Soul -1. She has purchased enough Skill Points to max her Base Skill Bonus at 6. 6 + 2 - 1 = 7. She also purchases the [Natural Intuition](#natural-intuition) and [Whispered Wisdom](#whispered-wisdom) Utilities, each of which increase her Empathy modifier by 1 more each. This gives her a total Empathy bonus of 9.

#### 1337 H4xx0r  
Increase your [Tech](#tech) and [Sabotage](#sabotage) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, when you break into a software system with your Tech skill, you may choose one of the following.  
* Logging: You leave a logger in the compromised system. This allows you to read all messages sent through or with the system.  
* Framing: You can plant files into the specified system.  
* Crashing: You can cause the system to crash. You can delay this crash for a specified amount of time, or set up the crash to occur under specific circumstances. Examples could be crashing when a given user logs in, upon visiting a given website, or when you set off a remote signal.  
* Trolling: You can cause the system to play loud music or videos, the nature of which is up to the hacker and should be calculated for maximum psychological damage.  
Record the result of the Tech check that originally gets you into the system. Anyone searching for your meddling can do so by rolling an Investigation or Tech check equal to or greater than this check.

#### Asceticism  
Increase your [Composure](#composure) and [Endure](#endure) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you can go 2 weeks without food or water with no ill effect, no need to make Endure checks. When you sleep, you enter a state of meditation and are still aware of the world around yourself. This enables you to awaken with full lucidity instantly and to make Awareness checks while sleeping without penalty.

#### Eidetic Memory
Increase your [History](#history) and [Lore](#lore) modifiers by 1.  
You are able to reliably remember information correctly. You may ask the Arbiter for clarification on things the character remembers but the player may not, and the Arbiter will give an accurate answer. This includes things like dates, times, names, articles in magazines, newspapers, or online.

> Player, ask the Arbiter before taking this Utility; this puts a lot more pressure on the Arbiter to remember everything. Both the Arbiter and the player should be open to improvising and hand-waving if the Arbiter misremembers, and the player should do their best to help this Utility along by taking notes of things they may remember.

#### Enhanced Sight  
Increase your [Awareness](#awareness) and [Investigation](#investigation) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you are unaffected by low or no light conditions. This could represent extremely acute hearing, access to infrared goggles, being able to cast a spell that lets one see in darkness, or other means of bypassing darkness. This does not significantly impact your ability to be seen in darkness like carrying a flashlight would.  
You are also able to see clearly up to a distance of 6 miles.

> Note: The average human can see up to 3 miles according to Wikipedia. For metric system, the average human sees up to 4.8 KM, and this Utility increases it to about 9.6 KM.
>
> I am aware this has more to do with the curvature of the planet than the way eyes work. If you need a tabletop system that takes that into account accurately I don't know what to tell you.

#### Extraordinary Saboteur  
Increase your [Sabotage](#sabotage) and [Stealth](#stealth) modifier by 1.  
You can set Traps. This could represent a tripwire, a pressure plate, a laser scanner, or something similar.  
You may set one Trap for every 5 Base Sabotage bonus (so 1 Trap at 5 Sabotage, 2 Traps at 10 Sabotage, and so on). Setting a Trap requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work. If you are interrupted during this time you must start over.  
Detecting your Trap requires an [Awareness](#awareness) check equal to your Sabotage bonus +10. Disabling or bypassing it requires a Sabotage check at the same target. You may disable and recover the components of your own Traps safely, and anyone you make aware of your Traps may bypass them safely.  
Each Trap you set can have 2 of the following attributes.  
* When the Trap goes off, everyone within a 300' radius knows. A bang, explosion, alarm, fireworks, or something similar occurs so everyone nearby knows the location of whoever set the Trap off.  
* The creature who set it off becomes locked in place. This could be a bear trap, a net or lasso, a pit, or something similar. The target is entitled to an [Acrobatics](#acrobatics) or [Athletics](#athletics) check equal to your Sabotage bonus + 10. On success they break free. On a failure they are [Rooted](#root) for an hour or until they receive assistance.  
* The target is damaged. When the Trap goes off you deal damage equal to a Sabotage check multiplied by 2. Every time you increase in [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) this multiplier increases by 1 (so x3 at Hero Tier 2, x4 at Hero Tier 3, and so on.) This damage is reduced by an amount equal to the target's Physical or Mental Defense, chosen when you set the Trap. This damage is either physical or of an element you have from [Elemental Attunement](#elemental-attunement).  
* The target is Injured. When you set the Trap, choose which [Attribute](#step-1-attributes) is Injured. If you choose Strength, Finesse, or Toughness, the target can make an [Endure](#endure) check to negate the Injury. If you choose Mind, Heart, or Soul, the check is [Composure](#composure) instead.  
If you set a Trap that exceeds your limit above, your oldest Trap deactivates.

#### Familiar bond
Increase the modifier of any one Skill by 1.
You can summon or create a familiar to help with mundane tasks outside of combat. This could be a small animal bonded to you, an automaton you’ve built, an object you’ve infused with life, or something similar. This familiar never participates in combat, hiding away where they will not be harmed. (For simplicity’s sake, you do not need to track the familiar during combat.) The familiar fetches objects, helps keep living areas tidy, can stand watch while your party rests, and other simple, non-violent tasks. If required to make a Skill check, the Familiar’s core stats are as follows:  
Strength -1, Finesse 1, Toughness 0, Mind 1, Heart 1, Soul 1    
Summoning a familiar is a ritual that requires an hour of uninterrupted work. This could be praying to nature spirits to send an ally, invoking the spirits of the dead to bind to a vessel, tinkering with clockwork components, or similar activities. If a familiar takes any damage at all, it immediately dies. The ritual for reviving a dead familiar or obtaining a new one is the same as acquiring the first one. 

#### Gangster's Cant  
Increase your [Deception](#deception) and [Streetwise](#streetwise) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you have learned the secret language of the criminal underworld. This allows you to understand signs and symbols to guide you to where such people gather and speak their language. A conversation spoken in Cant is impossible to follow without this knowledge.  

#### Mountain Climber  
Increase your [Acrobatics](#acrobatics) and [Athletics](#athletics) modifiers by 1.  
You are acclimated to high elevations and can survive at high altitudes without penalty. You have Boon +4 on all checks made to climb a slope or wall or maintain your grip on a ledge.

#### Natural Intuition  
Increase your [Diplomacy](#diplomacy) and [Empathy](#empathy) modifiers by 1.  
When you successfully detect that someone is lying to you with an Empathy check, you automatically gain a small insight into their motivations. This comes as a single word. Some examples:
* The target is being blackmailed by someone who can ruin their lives, forced to work against the party. “Fear”
* The target is a petty conman and just wants to score some easy coin off the party. “Greed”
* The party includes an elf, the target is an orc, and there is still long standing, mutual dislike between elves and orcs since a war between them two decades ago. “History”
* The target is secretly after revenge against someone in the party. “Enmity”

#### Poker Face  
Increase your [Composure](#composure) and [Deception](#deception) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you may use Composure to completely mask your emotional state, and you gain Boon +4 to do so. (This is only for concealing information; for actively misleading someone you would still need to use Deception.)

#### Specialist Artisan  
Increase your [Construct](#construct) and [Craft](#craft) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, choose a specialized type of crafting to specialize in. You produce items from within that specialization at double the normal pace and can presume you have materials and tools necessary to do basic repairs on items from that specialization at all times and/or are able to recycle existing items to gain those materials.  
For Construct, specializations could include arms, armor, masonry, carpentry, mechanics, heavy machinery, or similar specializations.  
For Craft, specializations could include clothing, jewelry, leather working, clockwork, leather working, and the like.

#### Stationary Stealth  
Increase your [Endure](#endure) and [Stealth](#stealth) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you are an expert at staying stealthy when still. If you have not moved within the last 10 seconds (1 round of combat), you gain Boon +4 on Stealth checks. For the purposes of this Lesson, 'moving' refers to moving to different squares; small shifts in position or posture do not remove this benefit.

#### Tracking Bug  
Increase your [Craft](#craft) and [Survival](#survival) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you can plant a Bug on a target to keep track of them. If you get within Long distance, you can attempt to plant your Bug by making a Survival check against your opponent's Awareness or Stealth check (target's choice). If you succeed, you plant your Bug on the target and can sense what direction and how far away the target is. At Hero Tier 1, this Bug lasts 1 day. This duration doubles every time you increase in Hero Tier (2 days, 4 days, 8 days, ...).  
A target can remove your Bug by attempting an Investigation check to find it with a target equal to 10 + your Survival modifier. The first attempt to remove your Bug takes 1 minute. If this fails, the second attempts takes 5 minutes. Each attempt after that requires twice as long as the previous check (10 minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes, ...). On success, the Bug is found and the target may remove or destroy it.  
This could represent a tracking spell, a homing beacon, a literal insect that helps you track the target, or similar means of sensing a target.

#### Trackless Traversal  
Increase your [Stealth](#stealth) and [Survival](#survival) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you and up to three allies may travel without leaving any sort of trail. Survival and Investigation checks made to follow you are made at Bane -4. Every additional traveler decreases the Bane severity by 1 (Bane -3 with four allies, Bane -2 with five, ...) This may represent using survival techniques to mask your tracks along with concoctions to mask your scent, activating boots that leave no trails, casting a spell of safe passage, or similar measures.  

#### Versatile Pilot
Increase your [Construct](#construct) and [Drive](#drive) modifiers by 1. (Choose one vehicle for Drive.)  
In addition, you can pilot a second vehicle with the same Drive modifier. For example, you could make your proficiency in horseback riding also apply to driving a chariot, or be equally skilled in riding a hoverboard and driving a car.

#### Well Connected  
Increase your [Diplomacy](#diplomacy) and [Streetwise](#streetwise) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you can assume you have connections in any non-trivial settlement you travel to. This can be the result of celebrity status, being a member of a well known and respected organization, or just having a lot of friends (or friends of friends) around the realm. This person should be generally friendly and/or sympathetic to your cause (within reason) and familiar with the customs of the region. Beyond that, your connections’ details are up to the Arbiter. Discuss the ramifications of this Connection with the Arbiter before taking it so they can prepare appropriately. When coming to a new location, you can ask the Arbiter who your connection is and what you know about them.

#### Whispered Wisdom  
Increase your [Empathy](#empathy) and [Lore](#lore) modifiers by 1.  
You can also glean information about locations or events intuitively. This can be consulting with spirits of the area, unlocking the memories of objects in the vicinity, getting brief glimpses of the past or future, consulting an advanced AI, and other ways one might gather small bits of information. You may conduct a ritual that takes at least one minute. Afterwards make a Lore check, the difficulty of which is determined secretly by the Arbiter. If you succeed, you can get a clear yes/no answer or a short, often cryptic phrase to guide you. If you fail, there will be no answer.  
To determine the difficulty of the Lore check, the Arbiter should consider several factors. How obscure is the topic being asked about? If it’s about a location, was it the location of significant events? Are there forces at work trying to keep the information hidden? If it’s about a person, how powerful are they? Powerful individuals are more difficult to learn about through this feature.   
After performing the ritual, you cannot do so again for the next eight hours. You cannot do this ritual again in the same place until either a year has passed, or you permanently increase your Lore modifier by 2.

## Other Utilities 

#### Aquatic  
You are able to function better under water. You can breathe water, are able to move through calm water effortlessly, and have Boon 4 on checks made to swim through turbulent water.

> In some settings where straight up water breathing isn't really viable for the PCs--for example, a game that takes place in a modern setting with only human characters--this Utility could instead represent access to oxygen tanks and gear for going underwater for at least 2 hours.

#### Hover  
You can fly up to five feet off the ground.  
This could represent wings that don’t quite have the strength to fully fly, a personal anti-gravity field, a spell that produces a hovering platform, or something similar.  
While not as versatile as fully functioning flight, this allows to you avoid hazards on the floor, reach a ledge that is otherwise too tall to get to, and any other advantage one could imagine comes with being slightly airborne.  
This does not protect you from falling damage; if you are suddenly more than five above the ground you will fall as normal.
This Lesson makes you immune to natural terrain effects.  
In addition, you are able to reduce the damage you take when falling by half.


#### Linguist  
You learn a language. This can represent doing scholarship and lessons just as well as a background living in a multilingual culture.  
You may take this Utility once per [Level](#level).

#### Lip reading  
You can read lips, i.e. if you are close enough to see a creature's face while it speaks, you know what they are saying. 

#### One with Nature: Animals  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with animals. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you gain a basic understanding of animal speech.  
Animals have simple, instinctual desires and are usually very focused on the here and now. Most quickly dismiss past events that don’t affect their ability to survive and don’t really understand “the future” as a concept.

#### One with Nature: Minerals  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with minerals. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you have learned to tap into a subtle consciousness that is present in stone, metal, and gems.  
Minerals have long memories, but no ability to move and thus a very limited frame of reference. They also have a difficult time telling moving things apart; seeking information about a specific person while speaking to stone is unlikely to be fruitful unless no one else has passed by in a very long time.  
You may only use this method of communication to speak with unworked minerals. The process of cutting gems for jewelry or forging metal for equipment “kills” the materials, rendering them silent to you.

#### One with Nature: Plants  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with plants. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you can hear the thoughts of plants from the smallest weed to the largest tree.  
If they are getting adequate resources to grow, plants are generally pleasant conversationalists, often talking about weather patterns or similar topics. Trees will discuss the lives of the animals living within their branches, and grasses will talk about grazers coming for them and being stepped on.

#### Sixth Sense  
XP Cost: 5  
You have a innate ability to sense supernatural influences. This can be angelic, demonic, undead, fey, eldritch, or anything between. When you focus your senses, you can detect if a supernatural being is within thirty feet of you. You know the creature’s general location and what sort of creature it is. You can also sense when supernatural forces have tampered with otherwise natural processes in a residual way.

#### Speak with the Ancient Dead  
XP Cost: 5  
Prerequisite: [Speak with the Recently Dead](#speak-with-the-recently-dead)  
Your ability to speak with corpses improves; now all that is required is an intact skull. The state of the rest of the body does not matter.

#### Speak with the Recently Dead  
XP Cost: 5  
You can speak with corpses. The corpses know everything they knew in life, up until the last day of their lives, which they completely forget. Corpses in this state have no emotions, and cannot learn new information, including the fact that they are dead. They also cannot move. The corpse must still have enough lungs and vocal cords to be able speak, or this Utility fails. This could be harnessing necromancy, utilizing nanobots to reconstruct what the body's brain knew, being an effective medium, knowledge of certain rituals, or similar measures.

#### Speak with the Recently Dead, Improved  
XP Cost: 7  
Prerequisite: [Speak with the Recently Dead](#speak-with-the-recently-dead), [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) 2  
You can learn more from corpses; corpses you speak with in this way now remember everything the knew up to the moment of their death. If you also have (Speak with the Ancient Dead)[#speak-with-the-ancient-dead] this effect extends to them.

# Chapter 9: Talents
A character gains a Talent for free at [Level](#level) 1, and again when gaining a Level divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15, ...).

#### Accelerated Assistance
When you use an Augment ability, you can also do one of the following:  
* Double the cost of the Ability to use it on another target without spending an Action.  
* Use an Augment Ability that normally costs a Major Action to a Minor Action. If you do this, you can only use one Augment on this round.  

When you gain this talent, you also learn either [Empower](#empower) or [Fortify](#fortify). If you have already learned both, you may refund the XP spent to learn one of them.

#### Battering Defense
You can physically batter aside your opponent's attacks. You may use your Strength in place of Toughness to determine your Physical Defense.

#### Body and Soul  
Your wholeness of spirit leads to wholeness of body. You may use your Soul in place of Strength to determine your HP.

#### Cascading Curses  
When you successfully strike a target with a Curse Ability, you can also do one of the following:  
* Double the cost of the Ability to use it on another target without spending an Action.  
* Use a non-Curse Attack or Spell Ability that normally requires a Major Action as a Minor Action. This Ability may not be of a higher Tier than the Curse that triggers this Talent, and must have the same target as the Curse that triggered this.  

When you gain this Talent, you also learn either [Enfeeble](#enfeeble) or [Expose](#expose). If you have already learned both, you may refund the XP spent to learn one of them.

#### Crushing Zeal  
Your attacks are powered by your spirit. You may use your Heart in place of Finesse to determine your Physical Offense.

#### Elemental Specialist (TYPE)
Choose one element: Fire, Cold, Sky, Earth, Light, or Dark. You gain the following benefits:  
* You gain [Elemental Attunement](#elemental-attunement) for the associated element.  
  * If you already have Elemental Attunement for the chosen element, you may either gain Elemental Attunement with a new element, or regain the 3 XP invested in gaining Elemental Attunement originally.
* You gain resistance to the chosen element.
  * If the chosen element was previously your weakness, you must choose a new element to be your weakness.
* If you spend an additional 1 MP per tier of the Ability you are using, you may convert physical damage you do into the chosen element.  
  * Tier 0 Abilities require no additional cost to convert.
  * Your converted damage still targets the usual Physical or Mental Defense.
* You gain an additional benefit unique to each element as follows
  * Fire - Successfully dealing Fire damage also inflicts [Degeneration](#degeneration) for 2 rounds, to a maximum of 6 rounds. Every time you increase in Hero Tier, the Degeneration added per hit increases by 1 round, and the maximum duration increases by 2 rounds.  
  * Cold - Successfully dealing Cold damage also [slows](#slow) the target for 2 rounds. If you successfully deal Cold damage to a target that is already slowed, they instead become [rooted](#root) for 1 round.
  * Sky - You may move before or after using an Ability that deals Sky damage. You must end your movement such that you still are within the triggering Ability's range to the target.
  * Earth - Successfully scoring a [Solid Hit](#solid-hit) while dealing Earth damage allows you to move the target one Square.
  * Light - Successfully dealing Light damage allows you give [shield](#shield-x) to an ally within the triggering Ability's range. The magnitude of this shield is equal to half the damage done.  
  * Dark - Successfully dealing Dark damage restores you for half the damage done. If you do HP damage you heal that amount, and if you do MP damage you restore that much MP.   
Note that to gain these benefits, the damage must be done by you personally. If using the Summoning module, your summoned allies do not benefit from this Talent.

#### Everlasting  
At the [Round End](#round-end) of every Turn, you regain HP equal to your [Vitality](#vitalitycapacity). When you gain this Talent, you also gain one level of Vitality without paying the XP cost.

If you ever reach zero HP, you cease regaining HP until you are given healing from another source.  

#### Flight  
Your maneuverability allows you to overcome gravity, be it through magical power, transmuting wings for yourself, equipping and successfully piloting a jet-pack, or similar means of propulsion. You gain the [Flight](#flight) property.  
This Talent makes the [Hover](#hover) Utility redundant. If you previously took the Hover Utility, you lose it but regain the XP spent.

#### Healing Hands  
You are an expert healer. When you use an Ability with the [Healing] tag, you may gain one of the following benefits:
* End a Curse effect on the target.
* Increase the target along one [Buff Track](#buff-tracks) of your choice. You can only increase the value up to 0.
* Reduce the duration of one [Status Ailment](#status-ailments) the target is suffering from by 2 rounds.

#### Heavy Hitter  
You hit so hard that you can knock your foes around without actively trying to. When you make an Attack and get a [Critical Hit](#critical-hit), you can choose one of the following extra effects.
* Knock your target(s) [Prone](#prone).
* [Stagger](#stagger) your target(s) for a number of rounds equal to your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).
* Move your target(s) one space. In the case of multiple targets, you must move them all in the same direction.  
You may only affect a given target with this Talent once per Turn. If you strike multiple Critical Hits with a single attack (such as using an Ability that targets a Square) you must choose the same effect for all creatures affected. You cannot affect a target with Heavy Hitter due to a roll that doesn't come with an Attack or Spell, such as maintaining a [Grab](#grab) or similar effect.

#### Intelligent Avoidance  
You’ve mastered how to avoid attacks by predicting their path. You may use your Mind in place of Finesse to determine your Physical Defense.

#### Lucky
You're just lucky sometimes. 
You may reroll a number of dice equal to 2 + your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier). Your rerolls refresh after you spend six hours not using any. You still cannot reroll dice that have already been rerolled, either through this Talent or through Boon/Bane.  
When you roll [Matches](#matches), you may gain one additional dice reroll.  
When you reroll dice due to Boon, you may keep the higher result between the two instead of replacing the previous roll.  

#### Mana Fountain
You gain 9 additional MP, plus 3 more for each point of [Capacity](#vitalitycapacity). This Talent applies retroactively to all levels of Capacity. When you gain this Talent, you also gain a point of Capacity without paying the XP cost.

#### Measured Strikes  
You practice a fighting style that emphasizes mind over muscle. You may use your Mind in place of Strength to determine your Physical Offense.

#### Muscle Mage  
You have trained in a magic style that uses strength of body over strength of mind. You may use your Strength in place of Mind to determine your MP.

#### Overwhelming Force  
You can draw magic power from your physical vitality. You may use your Toughness in place of Soul to determine your Mental Offense.

#### Perfect Protector  
At the start of your turn in combat, you may choose one of the following benefits. The chosen benefit happens automatically and does not require an action from you. You do not pay any MP or HP costs to use these options.
* Gain [Taunt](#taunt).  
* Use [Cover](#cover) on one Ally in your Square.  
* Use [Demand](#demand) on one Enemy within Medium range. (You may use this option even if you have not learned the Demand Ability.)

#### Precise Evasion  
You are able to avoid spells with agility. You may use your Finesse in place of Soul to determine your Mental Defense.

#### Serene Capacity  
You are able to power your spells with intuition and patience. You may use your Soul in place of Heart to determine your MP.

#### Skill Spell  
You make your spells more deadly by striking with superior control and aim. You may use your Finesse in place of Mind to determine your Mental Offense.

#### Sturdy Shield  
You can use your physical sturdiness to protect yourself against mental forces. You may use your Toughness in place of Heart to determine your Mental Defense.

#### Unyielding Zeal  
You can keep yourself going with sheer willpower. You may use your Heart in place of your Toughness to determine your HP.

# Chapter 10: Combat
Combat is frequently part of an exciting story. While not every game needs combat, many stories eventually lead to a conflict that cannot be solved peacefully. This chapter presents rules for handling said conflicts.

## Surprise/Ambush
The Arbiter determines who might be surprised in a given scenario. It often involves Awareness checks against Stealth checks, but different situations may call for different rolls. If a creature is surprised, it doesn’t act in the first round of combat and is treated as [Flat Footed](#flat-footed).

## Time in Combat
Actions in combat are organized into Rounds and Turns. Each set of actions a character takes constitutes that character’s Turn. A set of everyone taking their Turn is called a Round and represents approximately 10 seconds in game. Each Round is broken down into three phases.

### Round Start
At the start of the Round, everyone pays the Upkeep of any Abilities that have one, reduce the counter on Abilities that have Cooldowns, as well as any Abilities or effect with limited duration.

### Initiative Phase
Most combat takes place in the Initiative Phase.  
Before combat can begin, everyone needs to know the turn order. This is determined by the Initiative roll. Everyone rolls normally, adding their [Initiative Bonus](#initiative-bonus). The person with the highest result goes first, followed by the next highest, and so on until everyone has had a Turn.  
If there’s a tie, the creature with the higher Initiative modifier goes first. If that’s still a tie, then the two creatures make an opposed tiebreaker roll.  
You may choose to delay your Turn if you like. When your Turn comes, you simply declare who you want your Turn to come after instead. On the next Round, your initiative order returns to where it originally was.

### Round End
At this step you return to Round Start for the next round. Some Abilities, Lessons, and Talents add additional steps to the Round End, unique to each character.

### Major/Minor Actions
When your Turn comes, you get two Actions to work with: one Major and one Minor. Anything that would affect the state of the fight will fall into one of those two categories, and Abilities list in their descriptions whether they are a Major or Minor Action. Things such as speaking or movements that don’t really change the state of the fight do not require an Action. You may forgo any combination of your Actions if you don’t want to take them on your Turn; you’re not required to use them.  

### Counter Action  
Between your Turns, you have one Counter Action. Some Abilities allow you to use this action to do something on another combatant's Turn. Abilities that requires a Counter Action will list a condition that must be fulfilled before the action can be used.  
Refer to [Chapter 5](#chapter-5-list-of-abilities), and specifically the Abilities [Move](#move) and [Default Strike](#default-strike) for basic rules on how to move and attack.  

> When it’s not your Turn, you should be considering what your next action is going to be. Just because someone else is doing the talking doesn’t mean you should stop thinking. Actively planning your Turn during your friends’ actions means the game will be faster and more fun for everyone.

## Positioning
Knowing who you can reach and who can reach you is critical in combat, so these rules are here to help you keep up with the flow of a fight.  
Combat is broken up into Squares. A combat Square should generally be somewhere between 20-40 feet in length, square-ish in shape, and easy to understand on a quick drawing. It may represent a room or a hallway. A great hall in a large building may have several Squares. An open field would just be an effectively infinite number of Squares that characters can move through freely. Multiple creatures can occupy a single Square, and unless there is an Ability or circumstance saying otherwise everyone is able to get into melee range of everyone else in the same Square.

### Impact 
To make an Offense roll, first you roll your 2d10 as normal and add your modifier. If the Ability you are using to strike is labeled as an Attack, you use Physical Offense. Abilities labeled as Spells instead add your Mental Offense. Once you have this result, subtract your target’s Defense: Physical Defense for Attacks and Mental Defense for Spells. (There are exceptions which will be described in those abilities’ descriptions). The result is called the Impact, and if the Impact is above zero, your Ability has landed and will affect your opponent. By and large this will mean dealing damage, but some abilities instead impose conditions or something else unpleasant when they land. The amount of damage you deal is determined by multiplying your Impact by the Ability’s damage multiplier.

> Note that the term "Spell" is used as a term to differentiate from physical and mental strikes. An Ability listed as a Spell can function due to magic, technology, equipment, or similar sources.

#### Solid Hit  
Any Attack or Spell Impact that is 5 or higher is considered a Solid Hit. This by itself has no implicit effect, but some Abilities, Lessons, etc. may confer additional benefits on a Solid Hit.

#### Critical Hit  
Like Solid Hits, a Critical Hit is any Attack or Spell with an Impact of 10 or higher. This doesn't have any inherent effect (though it is likely going to be very painful for the target) but may activate other effects from Abilities, Lessons, etc.

#### Matches
Any time your 2d10 roll comes up on the same number, that is considered a Match. Like Solid and Critical Hits, this has no significant implication by itself, but may cause something to happen due to other effects on the character.

## Chasing rules
Sometimes when two opposing factions meet, one is not willing to stand and fight. This can result in a chase scene, in which one party is trying to get away from a pursuing party. The individual or group being chased is called the Quarry, while the one(s) doing the chasing are the Hunter(s).

### Position During Chases
During a chase, exact position doesn’t necessarily matter as much as distance between the Quarry and the Hunter. There is no need to make a large map to have a chase. Instead, assign each participant in the chase a number, representing how far they are from the chase’s starting point. This number is called the character’s Position, and it determines what they can do to other participants in the chase. At the start of the chase, the Hunter that’s farthest from the Quarry should be assigned Position 0, with others in the chase being assigned Positions based on how far from this starting point they are. Any action or effect that would normally cause you to move a Square instead allows you to instead increase (or decrease) your Position by 1.

### Endurance
A chase is as much about endurance as it is about speed. You start every chase with an Endurance score equal to your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) + Toughness + Heart. You can spend Endurance to use one of the actions described below, or preserve it in order to continue a long-distance chase.  
At the [Round End](#round-end) during a chase, everyone involved that moved that Round must make an Endure check. This check starts at a target of 10, and on a success nothing happens other than the target increasing by 2 the next Round. On a failure, you lose one point of Endurance and the Endure check’s difficulty goes back to 10 for the next Round.  
If your Endurance score goes negative, you lose that much HP every time you move a Square of your own volition.

### Actions During Chases
There are a few things one can do that is specific to chase scenes to consider.

#### Use Abilities
All Abilities available to you outside of a chase scene are available during chases as well. In order to use a Melee range Ability, your Position must match your target’s. To use a Close range Ability, your Position must be within 1 of your target’s; for Medium, 2; for Long, 3. Abilities that did only damage previously still do so, but any Ability that affects movement can be used to get an upper hand during the chase.

#### Rush
Rushing during a chase is a Major Action, and allows you to move three Positions at once. Doing this costs a point of Endurance.

#### Recover
Recovery is a Major Action, and you cannot use your Minor Action to do anything that causes you to move. This recovers one point of Endurance, up to a maximum of your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) + Toughness + Heart.

# Chapter 11: Health, Injury, Death, and Recovery
In the course of your group’s story, the players will face adversity. They will endure pain. Flesh fails, bones break, and blood flows. This is a part of adventuring, and all adventures make their own peace with this reality in time. This section of the rule book will describe the rules that govern this grim part of the hero’s journey.

## Damage Types
Broadly speaking, there are eight types of damage. Some beings may be vulnerable to some types while being resistant or immune to others. Ideally a party has a variety of damage types to work with with and can adjust to the enemy’s makeup as you go. Players are unlikely to know what types of damages work well upon first encountering a creature. They can use Scan Abilities to determine their targets’ elemental properties or try experimenting. Some things are reasonable to guess; an ice monster probably doesn’t like fire and doesn’t mind ice for example.

The damage types are as follows:
* *Physical* - Slashing, piercing, bashing. This is by far the most common type of damage.
* *Fire* - Burning, scorching, heat. Fire damage is broadly the way to describe damage that comes from using high temperatures.
* *Ice* - Piercing with icicles, chilling winds, sucking the heat out of the air. If the damage source is primarily low temperatures, it is ice damage.
* *Sky* - Zapping with lightning, being struck by slashing winds, and similar things. If it’s about electricity or wind, the damage type is Sky.
* *Earth* - Earth damage can be from launched rocks, being struck by plant vines, or a dip in acid. This is one of the more eclectic damage types, but it encompasses everything themed around the earth, from stones to the plants that grow from it.
* *Light* - Blinding radiance, searing lasers, holy light. Any time light itself is weaponized, it is light damage.
* *Dark* - Consuming blackness, draining life, unholy blight. If the damage comes from utilizing darkness or draining away the health of others, it is dark damage.
* *Almighty* - Beyond definition and comprehension, power in its rawest form. Almighty damage is extremely rare, and no force in existence can resist it.

With the exception of Almighty damage, enemies may have resistances or weaknesses to any combination of these damage types. A character can tell when they have struck a resistance or weakness as their blow lands; the results should be noticeably different from their expectations.  
If a damage type is not listed on an Ability, assume the damage to be physical.  

## HP
HP (hit points or health points, both work) are an abstract representation of a character’s health. While the character still has HP, they can press on. At a glance this could just be how much punishment the character can endure, but one could take it farther than that. Endurance, pain tolerance, mental fortitude, and dumb luck can all be part of a character’s HP.  

### Losing HP
Losing HP does not necessarily mean being struck by a weapon or attack. Remember, HP are abstract. Losing HP can be represented by narrowly avoiding a brutal attack (and thus using up one’s luck). It could be parrying a heavy blow, but suffering significant pain in one’s arm from the effort (testing one’s pain tolerance). It could be expending internal energy to throw an arcane shield up to deflect a spell (draining one’s endurance). And, maybe in the end, it could be getting a knife in the back. One should take getting hit as an opportunity for creativity, just like dealing a hit.  

### Reaching 0 HP
Upon reaching 0 remaining HP, a character is knocked unconscious and receives an Injury (explained below). They can take no actions and cannot be healed unless someone spends at least five minutes tending to them outside of combat or dangerous situations.  

## Injuries  
When you lose all HP, you take an injury and fall unconscious. You can’t move, take actions, and are completely unaware of your surroundings. Anything that would cause additional damage while you’re at zero HP causes an additional injury.  
Injuries in Story Shaper are the consequences of failing certain tasks or running out of HP. An injury reduces one of your [Attributes](#step-1-attributes) or [Vitality or Capacity](#vitalitycapacity) by one until it is tended to.  
When you sustain an injury in combat, roll a die and refer to this table for what type of injury.

##### Injury Type Table
| Die| Injury Type       |
|----|-------------------|
| 1  | Roll again twice  |
| 2  | Vitality          |
| 3  | Capacity          |
| 4  | Strength          |
| 5  | Finesse           |
| 6  | Toughness         |
| 7  | Mind              |
| 8  | Soul              |
| 9  | Heart             |
| 10 | None              |

1. *Roll again twice*. You've been struck so hard you take more than one injury with one blow.  
> In the unlikely event that a player rolls this more than once, the Arbiter should keep reasonable limits in mind. If the injury came from a minor brawl or from someone fighting without lethal intent, this result should not cause a character to suddenly explode with Injuries.  
2. *Vitality*. You've lost a lot of blood, taken an injury to your lungs or torso, or something similar that reduces your maximum health.  
> If this type of Injury (along with Strength or Toughness Injuries) causes a character's max HP to be 0 or less, the character should either die or fall into a coma, depending on the circumstances. In the case of a coma, it lasts until enough Injuries are healed to get the character back to positive max HP.  
3. *Capacity*. You've been concussed, suffered critical damage in your gear's energy storage systems, or something similar that limits how much energy you can bring to a fight.  
4. *Strength*. You’ve torn a muscle, broken a bone, lost so much blood that you can’t pack the same kind of punch as you used to, or something similar.  
5. *Finesse*. You’ve torn a ligament, broken your fingers, sustained nerve damage that makes movement difficult or painful, or otherwise lost mobility.  
6. *Toughness*. You’ve broken a rib and/or punctured a lung, lost a lot of blood, or otherwise picked up some affliction that makes you less vigorous than your best.  
7. *Mind*. You’ve suffered a concussion, have sight damage, are dealing with temporary memory loss, or some other problem that makes you duller than usual.  
8. *Soul*. You’ve suffered pain that breaks through your resolve, have a ringing in your ears, are generally questioning yourself, or something that interrupts your inner tranquility.  
9. *Heart*. You’ve suffered a concussion, severe pain, or perhaps perceive a betrayal (real or imagined) that makes you less sociable for the time being.  
10. *None*. You got lucky; while you still go unconscious, you suffer no lingering injury.  

As always, these methods of describing an injury are just suggestions. Players and Arbiters are free to come up with their own.

### Getting Injured
There are many dangers in an adventure that can result in an injury. The most obvious is hitting zero HP in combat, but this isn’t the only way. Here is a quick list of other ways to be injured. (Note that not all injury types are suitable in all circumstances. The Arbiter makes this choice and adjusts injury rolls appropriately. For example, if the dice roll a Heart injury from falling, the Arbiter may choose to reroll until something appropriate comes up.)
* Falling. Falling from a great height will typically result in injuries. For every 30 feet one falls, one will sustain an additional injury. Characters can make an Acrobatics check to try and reduce the damage from falling, reducing the height fallen by half the check’s result. Characters with [Flight](#flight) generally don’t need to worry about falling damage. Falling can cause Strength, Finesse, or Toughness injuries.
* Poison/Venom. The various creatures of the world may secrete harmful substances as they attack you. These will be listed in each creature’s information. A bite from a giant spider may cause a Finesse injury, while breathing in the spores of a territorial fungus might cause a Mind injury. These injuries can often be resisted with Endure checks.
* Traps. Slides into a spiked floor, arrows launched when a pressure plate is depressed, a bladed pendulum set to swing by a trip wire--these sorts of devious perils may cause HP damage, but they may instead leave lingering injuries, at the Arbiter's preference. They can typically be avoided with Awareness, Athletics, and/or Acrobatics checks. They can be disabled entirely with Sabotage checks.
* Fatigue. Circumstance forces a character to march throughout the night, forgoing food, water, and rest, through driving rain and cold and without shelter. This will wear on the character, and compounding fatigue is represented with injuries.
   * When going without sleep for a night, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take a random injury. On a success, you soldier on, but the next night you have to go without sleep you repeat the check with +5 difficulty. This continues stacking until you sleep for at least six hours. Failing this check does not reset the difficulty; only sleep can do that.
   * After two weeks without food, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take an injury to Strength, Endurance, or Dexterity. On a success, you can do without for a little longer. Every day spent without eating from here on requires another Endure check with +1 difficulty. This stacks until you get a good meal. Failing a check does not reset the difficulty.
   * After three days without water, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take a random injury. On a success, you can do without for a little longer. Every day spent without water from here on requires another Endure check with +4 difficulty. This stacks until you get a drink, and failure does not reset the difficulty.
   * Every day spent without shelter from severe rain, cold, or heat requires an Endure check, difficulty determined by the Arbiter based on the conditions. Failure results in an injury appropriate to the situation.

These are just a few examples, and the Arbiter can likely come up with more in their games.

### Recovering From Injuries
There are several ways to approach recovery of HP, MP, and injuries. Here are some recommended options. (Beyond healing Abilities, of course.)

* *Rapid, heroic pulp*.  The heroes bounce back from activity quickly, showing boundless energy. In this case, heroes regain all HP/MP after resting for 5 minutes. Recovering from an injury requires resting for an hour, which heals one injury of the player’s choice. 
   * This recovery method emphasizes action, enables risk taking, and encourages blowing everything quickly. This will result in faster battles since everyone is going full tilt at all times. Whatever happens will happen fast. 
* *Middle ground*. The heroes typically need a break after a dangerous encounter, and a long day of peril will wear them down. In this mode, resting for an hour regenerates HP equal to your Toughness + Character [Level](#level) and MP equal to your Heart + Character level (minimum 1 HP/MP per hour). Resting for eight hours regenerates all HP and MP and heals one injury. If the character is tended to by someone during this time, the tender may attempt a Medicine check, difficulty 10 + the number of injuries the target has received. On a success, the target heals one additional injury during their rest. 
   * This recovery system is a compromise, encouraging players not to blow everything immediately, but still potentially rewards explosive action and risk taking when appropriate.
* *Survival*. Damage lingers. Injuries will pile up. MP are precious. In this format, resting for eight hours regenerates HP equal to your Toughness + Character [Level](#level) and MP equal to your Heart + Character level. Healing from an injury requires two full days of bed rest. If the character is tended to by someone during this time, the tender may attempt a Medicine check, difficulty 10 + the number of injuries the target has received. On a success, you heal an injury every day instead of every two days. 
   * In this format, you must track resources carefully and spend them dearly. Players are likely encouraged to avoid combat when possible and play extremely frugally when it does happen.

## Death
There is a point past which a character’s body can no longer endure injury, and they perish. For the enemies, this threshold should be quite low. Expendable sorts who play no major role in the story should likely just die immediately when their HP are spent. Plot-centric characters may have a higher threshold, three to five. The death of a player character has much larger implications on the game and should be considered more carefully. My recommendation is to declare a character with ten injuries dead.  

### Resurrection
That is up to the Arbiter and should suit the setting. Allowing resurrection invites some serious questions. How common is it? What does it require? What stops antagonists from being resurrected after the heroes are done with them? The handbook is not going to set down hard rules for resurrecting dead player characters, because it should be custom to each setting. It’s worth noting that players are NOT necessarily entitled to this information. It’s up to the Arbiter.

## Status Ailments
Status Ailments are lingering problems that hamper a characters' ability to function in combat. Ailments always have a limited duration, and this duration can be reduced by effects such as [Remedy](#remedy) or [Healing Hands](#healing-hands). If multiple effects would cause the same Ailment, it instead increases the duration of the existing ailment.

> If a character is already suffering from the Daze Ailment with a duration of 2 rounds is struck by an attack that inflicts Daze for another 2 rounds, they now have Daze for 4 rounds.

#### Blind  
You cannot see. If you attempt to strike a target that you can hear or whose location you know without need for sight, you only roll a single die for the attack. You cannot effectively defend yourself while blinded as well, so attacks against you gain Boon +6.

#### Chill X  
Partially frozen or dealing with a lingering cold. This reduces your Physical Defense by X for its duration.

#### Crush X
Crushed by stones, blinded by sand, restrained by vines, or other similar means of hindering foes with the earth. This reduces your Physical Offense by X for its duration.

#### Daze  
Knocked off balance or punch-drunk. While you are Dazed you cannot take a [Counter Action](counter-action).

#### Degeneration  
You are afflicted with a condition that causes you to weaken over time. This could be bleeding, lingering burns, toxins, or the like. While affected by Degeneration, you lose HP equal to the remaining Degeneration duration on [Round Start](#round-start).

> For example, Cyrick currently suffers from 3 rounds of Degeneration. This causes him to lose 3 HP at Round Start. If nothing happens to change the duration of Degeneration on him, the next Round Start he will lose 2 HP. However, he sustains an attack that imposes 2 more rounds of Degeneration on his turn, leaving him with 4 rounds remaining. The next round, he loses 4 HP as a result.

#### Enervate  
Afflicted by a life draining curse, necromantic energies, disease, or similar hindrances. This reduces all life recovery you would receive by half for its duration.

#### Provoke
An opponent has demanded your attention. Any actions you take that affect opponents must include the creature that Provoked you, including any area of effect.  
Provoke overrides [Taunt](#taunt); you ignore Taunt effects that would divert you from striking a foe who has Provoked you. In addition, you gain no benefit of being [Protected](#protection) from a target you have Provoked.  
This may represent an opponent shouting insults to grab attention, minor mind control, jamming targeting systems, or other similar ways to demand your aggression in combat.

#### Root
For some reason, you cannot move. This might mean being tied down, having an injured foot, entangled in grasping vines, or similar things that stop you from moving. Being rooted does not otherwise affect your combat ability, you just cannot move from your current space.

#### Scorch X  
On fire or dealing with a lingering burn. This reduces your Mental Defense by X for its duration.

#### Shock X
Shocked, rattled by sonic damage, or the like. This reduces your Mental Offense by X for its duration.

#### Slow
You are hobbled in a way that makes you slower, though you can still move somewhat. While slowed, you cannot use your Minor Action to move to a different Square.

## Disadvantages
These are circumstances in combat that leave one in a disadvantage during combat. These generally cannot be dismissed through magical means.

#### Fatigue  
Extended combat can cause characters to become Fatigued, causing them to take additional damage. All damage multipliers against Fatigued characters are increased by 1. 

> This can be treated as a release valve for fights that are taking too long. If the Arbiter and players are getting tired of the fight, then it's likely the characters involved in the fight are starting to feel combat fatigue as well. If everyone agrees that it's time to wrap a fight up, all characters in the fight become Fatigued at the same time. I would recommend a minimum of 5 rounds before invoking Fatigue, and if everyone is still having fun in the fight longer than that then the characters can remain hearty enough to continue the fight as long as everyone wants.  
> Fatigue might also be imposed by certain monsters or effects, in which case the Arbiter might rule to treat this as a [Status Ailment](#status-ailments) instead of a Disadvantage. This makes it something that can be removed by effects like [Remedy](#remedy) or [Healing Hands](#healing-hands). 

#### Flat Footed
You are not prepared to defend yourself from attacks properly. Attacks against you are made at Boon +4. Unless otherwise noted, you cease being Flat Footed upon taking an action or being successfully struck by a damaging Ability.

#### Prone  
Lying on the ground. Melee range Abilities against Prone targets have Boon +3, while any Abilities coming from beyond Short range are made at Bane -3. Moving a Square while Prone costs a major action.  
You may fall Prone or stand up as a minor action.  

#### Stagger  
Knocked silly. While Staggered, you lose your Minor action and have Bane -1. Unless a different duration is listed, Staggers only last one Round (or 10 seconds outside of Initiative).  

## Advantages
These are circumstances that give the character in question an advantage.

#### Charged
You have prepared for a strong attack. When you have the Charged Advantage, you may choose to make your next Attack or Spell with Boon +6. Alternatively, you may increase the Damage Multiplier of the Attack or Spell by 1. Doing so removes the Charged property. Some Abilities require the Charged Advantage to function or add additional options to utilize your Charge.

#### Flight  
You can fly. This allows you to move into the airborne parts of the battle grid. Airborne movement is otherwise identical to standard movement.
This Condition makes you immune to terrain effects.

#### Obscured  
You are invisible or otherwise very difficult to see, which makes you extremely difficult to hit or track. Any foe that is able to target you with a single target attack makes said attack with only a single die. (Obscured provides no benefit against area of effect attacks.)

#### Protection
You are either providing an ally with Protection (the Protector), or are Protected by an ally.  
If you are the Protector, you cannot benefit from being Protected yourself. Standing in the same space as an ally with [Taunt](#taunt) grants you no benefit; enemies can freely choose between targeting you or the ally with Taunt.  
A Protected character cannot be targeted by offensive Abilities and is excluded from any offensive area of effect. You cannot be Protected from a foe you have [Provoked](#provoke).  
This can represent the Protector physically body blocking for the Protected ally, covering them with a shield, protection spells, and similar effects. 

#### Shield X
You have a barrier or defense active that takes damage for you. While you have any amount of Shield, damage done to you subtracts from your Shield amount before your HP. You cannot use Shield to pay HP costs, and effects described as "losing" life or HP (such as HP loss from low Endurance during a chase) still subtract directly from your HP. Shield gained from different sources stack.

#### Taunt
If you have Taunt and are in a space with any other ally, enemies must target you over other allies in the same square. Foes using Offensive Abilities that pick a single target can only pick you. Abilities that Abilities that affect Squares instead of targets can still affect your allies as normal.   
If multiple allies have Taunt in the same Square, foes may choose between them at will. Abilities that affect multiple targets in a Square (such as [Sweeping Strike](#sweeping-strike)) must prioritize targets with Taunt.  
[Protectors](#protection) are excluded from the redirection of Taunt and can be targeted as normal.  
A [Provoked](#provoke) combatant ignores Taunt, prioritizing instead whoever Provoked it.  
This might represent presenting yourself as an obvious target to draw fire, subtle mind control that redirects enemy attention onto yourself, or literally taunting people into fighting you first.
