# Chapter 0: Introduction  
Assembled friends and enemies, welcome to the Story Shaper System (S3) Handbook.  

## Who am I?  
Online I go by Proven Paradox; Dox for short, Josh if you prefer a normal name; he/him. I have been playing tabletop roleplaying games for over two decades. I've been a hobbyist game designer just as long--writing homebrew content for my game mastering, programming small video games, and the like.  

## What is Story Shaper System?  
S3 is a setting-agnostic tabletop RPG that is focused on being smooth and entertaining as a game while being flexible enough to run any genre, using only ten-sided dice.  
The core goals of Story Shaper are:  

* **Freedom.** Players describe their characters and actions however they want. There are no rules that restrain how characters or their gear look in this book (and never will be). While the abilities and skills on character sheets describe *what* a character can do, players describe *how* they do it.  
* **Depth.** The "game" portion of this roleplaying game focuses on strategic character building and interesting moment to moment decisions. Most of the rules are aimed at enabling character expression and providing multiple ways to approach problems, while combat rewards tactical thinking and teamwork.  
* **Speed.** S3 aims to make resolving conflicts quick and easy. Combat is simplified in a way that reduces analysis paralysis, and determining what numbers are needed for a given action is simple and consistent.  
* **Versatility.** This system is intended to be usable in any genre. Pulpy sci-fi, high fantasy, classic superheroes, and everything in between. What this system refers to as a "Spell" doesn't have to be magic. It could be powered by technology instead of magic, replacing a fireball with a heat ray. Alternatively, they could be re-imagined as gunslinger trick shots in a wild west flavored setting. Combat rules could be abstracted to represent something something less violent, such as a verbal battle between philosophers, with Offense stats representing persuasive ability and Defense representing poise and resolution.

# Chapter 1: How to Play  

```  
TODO: Consider how much of a "What are TTRPGs" section I want to write; low  
priority: For now anyone reading this document either already knows what  
TTRPGs are or were invited here by me personally, so not much urgency.  
```

## What you Need  
### Required:  
* An Arbiter. This is S3's term for game master; the person running everything other than the heroes.  
* At least one player.  
* The S3 Handbook (this page): https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Handbook.md  
* A [Character sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SpLmm85PxUhJBP4AtJBr99vJqZO9HvnlGro7OmUJT9A/edit?usp=sharing) for each player.  
* A pair of 10-sided dice (also called d10s) for each participant.  
> Characters focused on elemental damage often need three dice.  
* Pencil and paper.  
> Do not use pen or something you can’t easily erase. Trust me.  

### Useful but not vital:  
* A play mat with grid sections large enough to house multiple characters, or a dry erase surface.  
* A notebook for each player.  
For combat scenarios...  
* The Arbiter can refer to the [Adversaries and Monsters page](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Adversaries-and-Monsters.md#adversaries-and-monsters) for pre-created enemies.  
* Miniatures.  
* Props to illustrate terrains and objects on a map.  

> Hello. This is Dox, the game dev. We're in a box right now. Text in a Dox Box is me speaking to the reader directly rather than as part of the rules. In these, I'll add clarifications, examples, and recommendations to help understand the rules or run the game.  

## Rolling Dice  
Almost all dice checks go the same way. First the random factor: roll two 10-sided dice and add them together. This gives a range of 2 to 20, with middling results being significantly more likely than extremes.  
On top of that, each type of roll has a modifier depending on the entity's character sheet. Each is the sum of two Attributes and that roll's Realized Potential, a bonus purchased with XP. One can think of Attributes as representing a character's talent, while Realized Potential is the result of training and effort. (This modifier can be negative.)  
This is S3's core mechanic: almost all rolls are 2d10+ \[bonus\]. The higher this sum, the better the result.  

> For example, Alex is trying to climb over a fence with Athletics, which is based on Strength and Toughness. Alex's Strength is 1 and Toughness is 2, and he has Realized Potential of 2 in Athletics from his time in high school sports. His total Athletics modifier is +5. He rolls a pair of dice, getting a 4 and an 8. His total Athletics check is (4 + 8 + 5) 17.  

### Rerolls  
Some circumstances enable a creature to reroll one of their dice. A given die can only be rerolled once, even if the new roll would otherwise qualify to be rerolled.  

#### Boon  
Circumstances or character traits grant a character a conditional or temporary advantage are represented by Boon +X. When a roll is made with Boon +X, the character may reroll a die if it is equal to or less than X. They must take the new roll, even if it is lower.  

> Some examples of Boon in play:  
> Varna makes a Stealth roll with Boon +3. He rolls two dice and gets a 2 and a 6. He chooses to reroll the 2, getting an 8, giving a final result of 6 + 8 = 14, plus his modifier.  
> Marona is trying to haggle at a shop with Boon +4. She rolls a 4 and a 9. She is allowed to keep this roll if she likes, but chooses to use the reroll and gets a 1. Her final result is 9 + 1 = 10 plus her modifier.  

##### Boon Splitting  
If a character's Boon magnitude matches or exceeds the sum of both dice, both may be rerolled.  

> For example, Billy Baggins is sniping an enemy, and has Boon +5. He rolls a 3 and a 1. His Boon level is higher than both dice combined, so he may reroll both. He gets a 9 and a 4, resulting in a much stronger hit.  
> As a counter example, Jonny aims a gun and takes a shot that has Boon +2. He rolls his the dice and gets a 1 and a 2. This is not enough to reroll both dice, so he chooses to reroll the 1 and gets a 4. His final result of 2 + 4 = 6, plus any modifiers.  

```  
TODO: Continue review from here; highest priority: need to review text before
continuing development.  
```
#### Bane  
The unfavorable complement of Boon, Bane is imposed on a character when circumstances or sabotage make the character more likely to fail at a task. When a roll is made with Bane -X, the player must reroll their *highest* die if it is equal to or greater than (11 - X). Note that Bane does not go above -5, as rerolling any die below a 6 is statistically advantageous.

| Bane -X | Reroll a die above... |
|---------|-----------------------|
| -1      | 10                    |
| -2      | 9                     |
| -3      | 8                     |
| -4      | 7                     |
| -5      | 6                     |

Some examples of Bane in play:
* Adam is trying to follow tracks that have had some time to fade. This imposes Bane -3, meaning he must reroll any results over 8 (11 - 3). He rolls a 9 and a 1. Bane forces him to reroll the 9, which comes up as a 2. Final result is 1 + 2 = 3.
* XU-808 has Bane -4 on an attempt to repair a damaged mechanism with a Construct check due to them being on a ship that is currently engaged in chaotic combat. They must reroll any result above a 7. They roll a 7 and a 10. Because Bane specifies that one must reroll the higher die, the 10 is rerolled to a 3, for a final result of 7 + 3 = 10 plus any modifiers.

#### Combining Boon and Bane
If in a situation where Boon and Bane apply, they cancel each other out. Add their values and reroll based on the result. Some examples:
* Erin is attacking while affected by a blessing that gives her Boon +2, but is attacking an opponent who has a defensive spell that imposes Bane -1. Boon +2 and Bane -1 adds up to Boon +1, meaning she may reroll a die if she rolls a 1.
* Morris is attempting to pick a lock. He has picked these kinds of locks before on, so his familiarity gives him Boon +2 the check. However, his picks have been badly damaged in a way that, imposing Bane -3. Boon +2 and Bane -3 adds to Bane -1, meaning he must reroll a die if the roll is higher than 10.
* Arden is trying to leap over to a ledge. They have an item that augments their athletic ability with Boon +2, but a windstorm is making it harder with Bane -2. Boon +2 and Bane -2 adds to 0, so they will not have any opportunity or obligation to reroll dice.

#### Boon, Bane, and Multiple Targets  
When using a multi-target Ability, there may be situations where Boon or Bane applies to one or more targets in the effect but not others. (For example, one target may have a Curse on it that gives Boon to attackers while others do not.) In cases like this, resolve targets that are NOT affected by Boon or Bane first, then do appropriate Boon/Bane rerolls on the targets affected that ARE by Boon or Bane.

### Miscellaneous Rules  
Here are a few general rules prevent confusion.  

When counting Zones for movement or range, the count is orthogonal--i.e. excludes diagonal movements.

Round down during dice rolls. If you ever have a fraction, just cut off the fractional bit entirely. Even if your roll is (somehow?) 13.9, it rounds down to a 13.  

In combat, defenders win ties. For example, if using an offensive Ability results in the Offense role matching the defender’s Defense, the Ability misses and the defender suffers no consequence.  

For a tie during opposed Skill checks (such as Empathy versus Deception, or Awareness versus Stealth), both characters reroll until there is no tie. Any Boon or Bane on the original rolls still apply when rerolling due to a tie.

# Chapter 2: Character Creation  
Before you can begin playing a game of Story Shaper, you have to know who your Player Character (PC) is. This is the persona you’re taking control during the game. Your character sheet defines what they can do and what they struggle with. In this section, we will go through the steps of defining your character's capabilities.  
This chapter will focus on how the character is represented in rules. Fleshing out a character in the context of how that person fits into the world: their appearance, background, motivations, hopes, fears, and similar details should be an exercise mostly taken between the Arbiter and the player. These rules define what your character can do, but you decide who they are and how they do it.  
A blank character sheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SpLmm85PxUhJBP4AtJBr99vJqZO9HvnlGro7OmUJT9A/edit#gid=0). The sheet is set up to do a lot of the necessary math (Max HP, MP, etc) automatically.  

> Let's walk through the character creation process for two hypothetical characters to give an example as well as demonstrate a point.  
> 
> The first is being played by Eric. He joining his friends in a pulp sci-fi adventure, and he has decided he wants to play a robot. He names his character XU-808.  
> 
> Meanwhile in another game, Lydia is setting up with her friends to play a classic fantasy setting, and she has decided that she'll be the party's spellcaster. She names her new character Marona.  

## Step 0: Starting Out  
When a character is first created, they start at Max Potential 1 and Hero Tier 1. These values represent a character that is just getting started in their adventuring career. These values will be defined in a later step, for now just note these on your sheet.  

## Step 1: Attributes  
Attributes are the most broad representation of your character's capabilities. These numbers add directly to at least two other secondary statistics and are added in when making certain Skill checks (more on both of these subjects later).  
A zero represents average human performance in that Attribute, and from there it can go positive or negative. Two or above represents a gifted individual, and above five indicates superhuman ability. Negative two or below indicates an impairment that has a significant effect on one’s life, and negative five and below represents difficulty so severe that one cannot get by day to day without assistance.  
Your Arbiter will tell you the rules on how you determine your Attributes. For a standard game, my recommendation is to give 6 points to spend, with a cap of 3 points into one Attribute and the option to take a -1 in order to  get a 7th point. I recommend against randomizing Attribute generation.  

There are six attributes: Strength, Toughness, Finesse, Mind, Heart, and Soul. 
* **Strength** represents both raw physical power as one’s control and ability to utilize said force. High Strength could translate to generating a lot of force with unarmed strikes, or it could enable a character to carry heavier equipment than most. High Strength characters could be visibly muscular. Meanwhile, low Strength might result in the character being spindly or out of shape.  
   * Strength is also added to your Hit Points and Physical Offense stats.  
* **Toughness** represents health and hardiness. A character with high Toughness may never seem to tire from physical activity or shrug off injuries with relative ease, while low Toughness might mean the character is sickly or bruises easily.  
   * Toughness is also added to your Hit Points and Physical Defense stats.  
* **Finesse** represents how agile or dexterous your character is. High Finesse means that a character would generally move with grace, or perhaps represents good aim or dexterity. Low Finesse might instead implies general clumsiness and poor reactions.  
   * Finesse is also added to your Initiative, Physical Offense, and Physical Defense stats.  
* **Mind** represents intelligence and cleverness. A character with high Mind generally has a good memory, makes good grades if they put in the effort to do so, and is a great problem solver. Low Mind often means difficulty learning new technical concepts and a hard time remembering details.  
   * Mind is also added to your Mental Points and Mental Offense stats.  
* **Heart** represents charisma and intensity. Someone with high Heart is able to naturally be the center of attention and get along well with people, while someone with low Heart might naturally go unnoticed in social situations or just generally lack presence.  
   * Heart is also added to your Mental Points and Mental Defense stats.  
* **Soul** represents calmness and perception. Someone with high Soul might not be religious, but is likely very spiritual while also being good at reading people or noticing small details. Meanwhile someone with low Soul would generally have a difficult time with spiritual pursuits such as meditation and also have a general obliviousness to them.  
   * Soul is also added to your Initiative, Mental Offense, Mental Defense stats.
   
If you’re struggling to come up with your Attribute arrangement, here are a few recommendations that can help.  

* It is often useful to have at least one high Attribute. This ensures your character has at least one thing they are naturally good at, which can help define their role in the group (both in and out of combat), as well as guide the character creation process.  

> Note that generalized Attribute spreads still absolutely work. Jack-of-all-trade characters can be a bit more challenging to build, but have broader capabilities and options to weave different fighting styles together. Broadly distributed Attributes also enable a character to have a naturally broad range of non-combat capabilities.  

* That said, be careful about overspecialization in combat. During fights most characters want to be particularly good at doing one thing, but if you leave your character unable to do anything else at all you may end up unable to contribute in many situations. Any PC who takes only melee range offense options is helpless against flying foes. A knight who has a very high HP pool along with high Defenses is durable, but if said knight has no means of dealing damage or drawing a foe’s attention the enemy may just ignore them in a fight. An alchemist character with tremendous MP and Mental Offense may do a lot of damage, but if their HP and Physical Defense are too low they will have a bad time when enemies get too close.  
   * This can be an *issue* outside of combat scenarios, but is not necessarily a *problem*. While combat scenarios usually involve the PCs working together on equal footings, non-combat scenarios can be natural places for a specific character's skill set to shine while other characters support them. A thief specialized in stealth and infiltration can lead a heist while a hunter with high awareness keeps watch or waits for a signal to assist. A trickster character with a silver tongue and quick wit can charm and deceive their way through a fancy party, with a warrior friend by their side to provide intimidation and to step in if things get ugly.  
* Coordinate with other players at the table. There are several ways characters can interact that make all involved stronger. A character focused on support abilities can help a physical attacker do more damage, while a defensive character can provide cover for a fragile spellcaster. If the group features some players who want to fight monsters while others prefer non-combat scenarios, those players should discuss things they could do to support each other. The combat oriented players might take some specific options that let them cover an important area the non-combat players need help with, while the non-combat characters might take options that support the eager combatants.  
   * This can be an in-character process as well; a group of people who do perilous work together will naturally figure out ways to keep each other safe in their adventures.  

> Eric considers XU-808's Attributes. His Arbiter has given him five points to work with. He reasons that his robot character should have high Mind to represent their ability to calculate quickly as well as a strong memory, so he puts their Mind to 3. Being made of metal instead of skin, he also figures XU-808 should be pretty tough as well: the last 2 points go to Toughness. He also reasons that his newly-created robot is socially naive and logical in a way that makes them hard to relate to. To represent this (and with the Arbiter's permission), he makes their Heart -1. The Arbiter allows him to get an extra Attribute point for this, which he uses to increase his Toughness by one more step. After all this, XU-808's Attributes are Strength 0, Toughness 3, Finesse 0, Mind 3, Heart -1, Soul 0.  
> 
> Lydia does the same thing for Marona. Her Arbiter has set the Attribute rules down ahead of time: 5 Attribute points, permission to take one negative Attribute for a 6th, and a hard cap of 3 points in any one Attribute. She expects to be using a lot of spells, so she prioritizes Mind to get a lot of MP and Mental Offense to work with. Since it's her highest priority, Marona's Mind is maxed out at 3. She's also expecting a lot of combat in her game, so she wants to give her character the best chance to survive it. Looking over her options, she concludes the best way to do this is to increase her HP. She doesn't need Physical Offense at all, so she puts the rest of her points into Toughness so it also boosts her Physical Defense. She decides she'd like to really focus on being sturdy, so she looks over her Attributes for one she can afford to drop. She decides that the right answer would be Heart. She has ulterior motives (which we'll talk about later) but decides to justify it by framing her character as being an academic who has spent more time with books than people, making her socially awkward. She adds the extra point to Toughness. Her final stats for her wizard are Strength 0, Toughness 3, Finesse 0, Mind 3, Heart -1, Soul 0.  

The next two steps are aspects of your character that emerge from your Attribute distribution. These steps are calculations, all of which the character sheet linked earlier does for you.  

## Step 2-a: HP/MP  
After choosing your Attributes, you can determine your point stats.  
* **Max HP:** HP stands for hit points or health points, and they are an abstract representation of a character’s health. While the character has HP, they can still press on. Your character starts with 15 plus your Strength times 3 plus your Toughness times 3 HP.  
   * [15 + (STR x 3) + (TGH x 3)]  
* **Max MP:** MP stats for mental points or mana points. While some combat maneuvers spend HP, most require you to spend MP to use them. What this represents can be very abstract; it could represent a pool of mana to draw power from, concentration and energy needed to perform a complex maneuver in a fight, or it can be as simple as tracking ammunition. Your character starts with 15 plus your Mind times 3 plus your Heart times 3 MP.  
   * [15 + (MND x 3) + (HRT x 3)]  

The sheet also lists a field for Vitality in the HP calculation, and Capacity for MP. Both of these values start at 0, and will be explained in the next chapter.  
 
> Both XU-808 and Marona have to calculate their point stats now. For HP, their Strength is 0 and their Toughness is 3, so [15 + (0 * 3) + (3 * 3) = 24] is their starting HP. Mind 3 and Heart -1, so [15 + (3 * 3) + (3 * -1) = 21]. These numbers represent a decent starting point for both HP and MP levels; not spectacular, but enough.  

## Step 2-b: Offense/Defense/Initiative  
These are values that are used when rolling dice in combat. Offense is a general increase to your attacks’ effectiveness, Defense represents or your ability to mitigate incoming strikes, and Initiative determines the order in which characters act.  
Each of these sections on the character sheet have a field for Realized Potential. For new characters, these values all start at 0. Raising these values will be discussed in the next chapter.  

#### Physical Offense  
This broadly represents your ability to attack foes by mundane means. The better your Physical Offense, the more likely you are to successfully hit foes and do more damage with fists, melee weapons, and mundane missile attacks. A high Physical Offense could imply raw strength, extensive training, precise aim, and other such characteristics. You add your Strength and Finesse to Physical Offense.  

> Our example characters have Strength 0 and Finesse 0, so their starting Physical Offense is 0. Which is totally fine; they can just create characters that doesn't ever use Physical Offense.  

#### Mental Offense  
This broadly represents your ability to manipulate energy, technology, or other non-physical forces to strike out at foes. High Mental Offense could imply a deep well of mana to draw upon, better understanding of technology used to inflict harm on others, a connection to some external power source you channel to lash out at your enemies, or something similar. The term “mental” is here mainly to differentiate it from “physical” and could easily be adjusted to apply to technology, magic, psychic powers, natural weapons, or other such power sources. You add your Mind and Soul to Mental Offense.  

> With Mind 3 and Soul 0, XU-808 and Marona have a starting Mental Offense of 3. A good starting point for building up their characters' damage capabilities.  

#### Physical Defense  
This statistic represents your ability to mitigate mundane strikes sent against you. This could imply being quick enough to dodge attacks, tough enough to just ignore them, being equipped with armor or shields to protect you, or a combination of these effects. You start with 10 Physical Defense, plus your Toughness and Finesse.  

> Both characters have 3 Toughness and 0 Finesse, so their Physical Defense starts at 13. Both characters are fairly resilient to physical harm.  

#### Mental Defense  
Mental Defense enables you to mitigate damage you would otherwise take from technical or magical attacks. High Mental Defense can imply being trained in counterspells or arcane shielding techniques, understanding and utilizing equipment or technology that dampens or redirects energy targeting you, carrying a shield that deflects magica, just being so resilient that you can endure the attack without harm, or the like. You start with 10 Mental Defense, plus your Heart and Soul.  

> Both characters have Heart -1 and Soul 0. They start with Mental Defense at 9. Unlike their low Physical Offense, this is a weakness that can be a significant problem for these characters.  

#### Initiative Bonus  
At the beginning of a dangerous encounter (usually but not always combat) everyone involved make Initiative rolls. This determines the order in which characters act. You add your Finesse and Soul to Initiative rolls.  
Initiative can also be used to determine who reacts first in an out-of-combat context. If characters are ever attempting to do something at the same time and the order of actions is important, have all parties roll Initiative; whoever rolls the highest is the first to act.  

> Marona and XU-808 have Finesse 0 and Soul 0, so their Initiative is 0. Not ideal, but not all character need to prioritize acting first.  

## Step 3: Abilities  
The next step is to choose Abilities. Chapter 4 goes into greater detail on what an Ability actually entails, but in short an Ability represents something that characters can do in combat. You can think of these as the verbs you can perform in fights. These will define your character's fighting style. Characters start knowing all Tier 0 and with 3 Tier 1 Abilities.  

Some advice if you are having trouble choosing your Abilities:  
* You should have at least one Ability that fits within your character’s intended skill set. Your Strength dominant hero should have at least one attack. A Mind/Soul dominant hero is going to want Abilities that use Mental Offense. A character with high defenses can better leverage them if they choose Abilities that force enemies to target them instead of more fragile allies.  
* That said, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If all of your attacks are melee range then an enemy who attacks from a distance will be a severe problem for you. If you have nothing but healing or support Abilities, then you will be helpless if you get separated from your allies. Once you have your core covered you should add some variety to your arsenal.  
* At first your HP and MP pool will be limited. Keep costs in mind when picking Abilities. If an Ability requires too much of your MP to use often, it might be better to set that aside until you've gotten stronger.  
* Once your major bases are covered, it is often useful to choose at least one Ability that requires a Minor Action to use. Doing so allows you to increase your effectiveness by letting you more consistently use both of your Actions. (Actions are described in more detail in Chapter 10.)  
   * The same could be said for choosing at least one Ability that is a Counter Action, but Counters are more situational than Minor Actions.

He likes the idea of a lightning ray, so XU-808 starts with the Elemental Lance Ability, taking the Sky Attunement version to represent the electrical element. He also wants XU-808 to be able to scan enemy shields, so he takes Scan. Finally, he wants a cloaking device, so he takes Vanish as his final starting Ability.  
>
> Meanwhile Lydia considers her Abilities. She wants Scan because she plans to build Marona into an elementalist, so she needs to know enemy weak points. She also wants a way to escape bad situations, so she takes Vanish. Finally she needs to be able to damage. She decides to start her character off using wind slashes, so she picks Elemental Lance with Sky Attunement.  

## Step 4: Skills  
Next, you will distribute Skill Points. Chapter 6 covers Skills in detail, but the general idea is that Skills are things that your character are good at besides fighting. These are verbs for your character outside of combat. Each Skill starts off based on two Attributes. For example, the Acrobatics Skill adds your Strength and Finesse Attributes; History adds Mind and Soul; Stealth adds Finesse and Mind; and so on for each Skill. You can think of the Attribute bonus as a character's talent level in a given activity; how good they are at the thing with no extra training or preparation.  
In addition, each Skill has a Realized Potential modifier, representing training, study, and/or practice of the Skill in question. The reason for the term "Realized Potential" will be discussed in the next chapter, but for now you can think of this as the effect of your character's active effort rather than passive talent. You can increase your Realized Potential in a Skill for one Skill Point. All characters start with 20 Skill Points to spend, with a maximum Realized Potential of 4.  

Here are some things to consider when distributing skill points:  
* Skills are the portion of character creation most closely tied to roleplaying. Other aspects of the system have been intentionally divorced from having an impact on roleplay, but you should choose Skills that make sense for your character to have from a story perspective. Think about the things a person with your characters' history would be good at.  
   * Don't let that limit you though. Having an unusual or out of character Skill can be very compelling as well.  
* If you’re satisfied with your character’s representation but still have Skill Points remaining, consider coordinating with the other players. A given party would typically benefit from having most of their bases covered, so if you have points left and there's a major gap in the party's capabilities, it might help the whole group to use those spare points to fill that gap. (Explaining how your character comes to have said Skill could be an interesting prompt for extra details in your PC's background as well.)  
* If you’ve done the above and still have Skill Points, then consider increasing Athletics, Acrobatics, Awareness, Composure, Empathy, or Endure. These Skills are either universally useful, reactive in nature, or beneficial for the party to have multiple members able to use them well.  

> Eric considers XU-808's Skills. Going down the list, he first spots Composure. Eric likes the idea of high Composure representing his robot being difficult to rattle emotionally. He decides for simplicity to just max things out as he chooses them, so he puts 4 points into Composure. Next he spots Endure--pain tolerance, going without food, his robot should be good at that too. 4 points in Endure. The next two Skills that catch his interest are Investigation and Science. He decides that XU-808's primary function is as a researcher, and puts those two skills to maximum.  
> 
> Meanwhile Lydia thinks about what Marona should able able to do. Like Eric, she decides to just max four Skills. Lore obviously, a wizard needs to know magic stuff. She knows her Arbiter likes to throw in a lot of horror elements, so she figures Composure will be useful to withstand the eldritch knowledge she'll be gathering. She also likes the idea of Investigation, better to find new spells with. And finally in previous games she remembers having a few hard Endure checks, so she decides to put her last points into Endure.
> 
> After adding in Attributes, the two characters have the following Skill checks:  
> 
> Composure +7, Endure +6, Investigation +7, Lore +7 (Marona), Science +7 (XU-808)  
> 
> All their other skills are done just with their Attributes.  

## Step 5: Elemental Properties  
In settings where elemental magic is common, your character can start with a Weakness to one Element and a Resistance to one other. The available Elements are Fire, Ice, Sky, Earth, Light, and Dark.  
Elemental properties are not appropriate for all settings or all characters. Consult your Arbiter on whether you should do this for your character when creating them.  
The effect of Elemental Properties is described in Chapter 4. For now; you take significantly less damage from Elements you Resist, and more from Elements you are Weak to.  

## Step 6: Talent  
Finally, you choose one Talent. Talents are described in full in Chapter 9; these are major changes that help define what your character excels at. These can allow you to act more efficiently, add powerful benefits for specific types of Abilities, or expand how you can use your Attributes.  

> Eric looks over the available Talents for something that looks interesting. He spots Sturdy Shield and decides that could represent XU-808 having energy shields installed.  
> 
> Meanwhile Lydia looked ahead to plan her build. Since she took a point away in Heart, she decides to use Sturdy Shield, using her strong Toughness to partially negate the downside of her low Heart.  
> 
> In both cases, this means that their Mental Defense goes from 9 to 13.  

## Step 7: Starting items  
There are no rules for mundane items or equipment in this system. Axes and swords don't have different stats. A character starts with their most essential items (weapons, armor, tools) already on hand. Unless there are specific circumstances that say otherwise, characters can hand-wave having access to common tools for their profession.  
The basic idea is that characters in S3 are distinguished by what they can do, not what kind of gear they have. If you're playing a character with high strength, they can start with appropriate weapons. If your character is a mage, they can start with any implements they need to use their magic. If you're playing a very sturdy character, they could start with armor or a shield. Having the Shoot Ability implies the presence of a bow, gun, crossbow, throwing spears, or something similar. An experienced soldier has the tools needed to maintain their gear somewhere, and a scholarly character has what they need to write down their observations somewhere in their bags.  

> Note that steps 8 and 9 can be skipped for brand new players. If this is your first time with S3 and you want to get straight into it, you can skip these steps, and with them skip reading chapters 7 and 8. This will let you get a taste of the system without committing to reading every chapter of this book. If you play for a while and find you like the system, you can come back to these steps to finish fleshing out your character.  

## Step 8: Lesson  
New characters start knowing one Lesson. Lessons represent a character specializing in specific abilities or fighting styles in the form of passive bonuses or new options. If Abilities are combat verbs, Lessons are combat adverbs. They are described in full in Chapter 7.  

> XU-808's sheet is nearly complete. After looking over the options, Eric decides to take the Superior Scanner Lesson, reasoning it could represent being built with advanced scanning equipment.  
>
> Meanwhile Lydia takes the same Lesson because she expects to be using Scan frequently to find enemy weaknesses a lot and wants to get as much as she can out of said actions.  

## Step 9: Utility  
Next, you choose one Utility. Utilities represent non-combat specializations, giving you a boost to certain Skills or a new option that gives the character broader capabilities off the battlefield. These are non-combat adverbs.  
Utilities are listed in Chapter 8. You may only choose a Utility with the standard 3 XP cost; Utilities that cost additional XP cannot be taken as your starting Utility.  

> Eric decides Eidetic Memory is an easy choice to represent XU-808's computer having perfect memory.  
>
> Meanwhile Lidia just likes being able to ask the Arbiter to fill in occasional gaps in her memory, so she takes the Eidetic Memory Utility to give an explanation on how her character keeps all those details in her head even though the player cannot.  

...And with that, you have a fresh character ready for adventure.  

------------
# Chapter 3: Improving your character
In S3, rather than progressing in a class, heroes become stronger by spending experience points (XP). This will allow you to choose between a highly specialized character with a small number of very effective abilities, or a character that has many different tools, making them more likely to have exactly what is needed for a given situation.

> XU-808 and Marona start the game with nearly identical sheets. However, as they grow they begin to diverge in specialized ways.

## Gaining XP
This section will focus on how the party gains XP, and is mostly of concern to Arbiters.

```  
TODO Rewrite to properly codify this at some point ; low priority: more of the 
system needs writing before this is codified. For now:  
```  
The rate at which characters grow in power is, in the end, a matter of taste. There is never going to be an optimal way to schedule out how characters grow. There are no set rules on this.

> There are, however, recommendations I can give based on the results of my play testing. These are boxed because I'm going to be speaking in first person and from experience as an Arbiter rather than as a game designer.  
> In general, my recommendation is that a typical session that moves the plot forward gives the players 1 XP. This allows for slow, steady growth that you can reasonably keep on top of as an Arbiter. Sessions that involve a higher amount of risk or danger should give more XP, but not a ton more. I would say the completion of a story arc would merit 5 XP. Other sessions would fall somewhere between those two extremes.  
> Note that this does not only apply to overcoming physical danger. A tense negotiation might result in XP as much as a combat encounter.    
> If you go too slowly, players may come to feel stagnant or under-rewarded. Giving too much XP too quickly makes it more difficult to design suitable encounters for the players; if the player characters' strengths increase substantially session to session then you're at greater risk of substantially under or over estimating what makes for a good fight. Either of those results can be a disaster.   
> My play-testers all agreed that they'd prefer they all have the same XP. Other groups might disagree; it might be that players who don't show up don't gain XP, or perhaps the Arbiter might like to give bonus XP for helping to run the game. Discuss this with the group before you begin playing.  
> I strongly recommend against giving role-playing XP. If the players don't want to role-play, that's fine; run a dungeon delving group. Role-play is supposed to be for its own sake.  

## Spending XP
Between sessions, you can allocate your XP to buy benefits as listed in this section. Keep up with what XP was spent in what way on your character sheet.  

If you're looking specifically for the XP cost of specific benefits, refer to this cheat sheet.  
### Table: XP Cost Cheat Sheet

| Benefit                 | XP Cost                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Increase Max Potential  | 4 + current Max Potential |
| Vitality/Capacity       | 3                         |
| Physical/Mental Attack  | 4                         |
| Physical/Mental Defense | 3                         |
| Initiative              | 1                         |
| 4 Skill Points          | 1                         |
| Tier 1 Ability          | 3                         |
| Tier 2 Ability          | 5                         |
| Lessons                 | 5 unless otherwise stated |
| Utilities               | 3 unless otherwise stated |

> An Arbiter might also give explicit moments in the middle of a session to spend XP when it suits the narrative. For example, if a character is put into a situation where they are actively training, an Arbiter might give the character the opportunity to buy Skill Points or stat improvements related to that training.  

### Max Potential  
Max Potential represents how well a character can perform at their absolute best. Coming from other systems, you might think of this similar to how character levels usually work.  
A character's Max Potential acts as a cap on certain values on your character sheet, which can only increase up to the hero’s Max Potential. It limits the following:  
* The number of times Vitality and Capacity can be purchased.  
* The hero’s Realized Potential bonus on Physical Offense, Physical Defense, Mental Offense, Mental Defense, and Initiative Bonus.  
* The Realized Potential bonus on your Skills is limited to your Max Potential + 3.  

When you increase your Max Potential, you also gain an immediate benefit that repeats in a five step loop. These benefits do not cost additional XP.  
* When reaching Max Potential 2, 7, 12, … the character gains one point in Vitality or Capacity.  
* When reaching Max Potential 3, 8, 13, … the character increased their Physical or Mental Defense's Realized Potential by 1, plus increases one of their Attributes by 1.  
* When reaching Max Potential 4, 9, 14, … the character increases their Physical or Mental Offense's Realized Potential by 1.  
* At Max Potential 5, 10, 15, … the character gains a Talent (more on Talents in [Chapter 9](#chapter-9-talents)).  
* When reaching Max Potential 6, 11, 16, … the character gains an Ability of any tier they could normally learn (more on Abilities in [Chapter 4](#chapter-4-abilities)) and increases their Hero Tier by 1.  

Increasing Max Potential represents pushing through the plateaus and putting in the work that comes with growing and developing mastery in any field. That could represent the character undergoing extensive training or practice in the background, studying hard between adventures, or just getting better with experience.  
> It might be good to have a plan about when to increase your Max Potential. XU-808 is mostly interested in Skills, and so increases Max Potential up when their Skills are all maxed out, choosing combat stats only when they feel it necessary.  
> Meanwhile Marona generally increases Max Potential when she's taken Magic Offense, Vitality, and Capacity to their current maximums.  

Characters start at Max Potential 1. Boosting Max Potential to 2 costs 5 XP, and each subsequent Max Potential increase costs (4 + current Max Potential) XP. So Max Potential 3 costs 6 XP, Max Potential 4 costs 7 XP, and so on.

> \<Milestone Max Potential Boosts>: Instead of allowing players to purchase Max Potential, the Arbiter may instead choose to declare that all characters increase in Max Potential at certain milestones within the story. While this does constrain players, it also ensures a given party will have fairly similar power ranges. This makes it easier to balance combat encounters while also making major milestones feel more impactful.

#### Hero Tier
Hero Tier is a value that broadly represents your character's power. You start at Hero Tier 1, and every 5 Max Potential boosts after the first (6, 11, 16, …) increases this value. This value is used in scaling for several different Abilities, Lessons, and Utilities. It also limits what Abilities you have access to: You can only take Abilities of a Tier equal to or less than your Hero Tier.  

### Vitality/Capacity
Vitality and Capacity increase your character's [Max HP and MP](#step-2-a-hpmp) respectively. Purchasing Vitality increases your hero’s maximum HP by 5 + their Strength + their Toughness. Purchasing Capacity increases your hero’s maximum MP by 5 + their Mind + their Heart. Both of these can be purchased multiple times, up to your character’s [Max Potential](#max-potential). Vitality and Capacity upgrades cost 3 XP.

> Both XU-808 and Marona need HP and MP, so they both take Vitality and Capacity levels occasionally. XU-808's game is less combat focused though, so Marona prioritizes these stats higher than XU-808.

### Realized Potential 
Your character's Offense, Defense, Initiative, and Skills start with a bonus based on your [Attributes](#step-1-attributes). As you gain XP and power, you can spend that XP to increase each of these values, representing practice and effort to improve those aspects of your character.  

#### Offense, Defense, Initiative  
Every character has a Realized Potential bonus to their Physical and Mental Offense and Defense. It starts at 0, but of these statistics can be increased up to the hero’s [Max Potential](#max-potential).  
Increasing Realized Potential for Physical or Mental Offense costs 4 XP. Increasing Physical or Mental Defense costs 3 XP. Increasing Initiative costs 1 XP.  

> Marona's primary role in her party is to deal Mental damage, so she spends most of her effort on her Mental Offense's Realized Potential. Meanwhile XU-808 has ended up the most sturdy character in their game, so to extend this advantage they take base Physical and Mental Defense as a priority.  
> Since they are providing a guardian role for their party, XU-808 purchases Initiative bonuses when they can so they can act to quickly defend their friends. Since Marona is more focused on damage and has the defenses to soak a hit if she needs to, she decides to allow Marona's Initiative to stay at its base value.  

#### Skill Points  
Skill Points are used to improve at a Skill. You may spend 1 XP to gain 4 Skill Points, each of which increases a Skill's Realized Potential by 1. The maximum number of points you can put into any individual Skill is 3 + your [Max Potential](#max-potential).  

> Marona is in an action packed game where danger is everywhere. She quickly finds that she can use points in Awareness, Endure, and Stealth. She also maxes out her Lore and Investigation Skills as she delves into deeper arcane secrets.  
> 
> Meanwhile XU-808 is in a much more social game where solutions are usually negotiated rather than fought over. They reason that the adaptive AI that XU-808 runs on would learn Diplomacy. They also like the idea of self modifying their chassis, so they take Construct and Tech to represent that capability. The remains their team's main Science officer.  

### Abilities  
Abilities represent things you can actively do, typically in combat. These can come from training in elaborate techniques, learning spells, building equipment, natural biology, or whatever justification is suitable for a given hero being able to do something.  
Abilities come in three tiers. <For now. More are planned in future.> You may only purchase Abilities from tiers less than or equal to your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier). They cost 1 + (2 \* their tier) XP. So 3 XP for tier 1, 5 for tier 2. All characters begin the game knowing all Tier 0 Abilities for free.  
Abilities are described in more detail in [Chapter 4](#chapter-4-abilities) and listed individually in [Chapter 5](#chapter-5-list-of-abilities).  

> In XU-808's game, they ended up the sturdiest character in the party. They decide to focus on this, taking Abilities like Guard and Protector's Presence to defend their allies during combat.  
> 
> Meanwhile in Marona's game, there is another player who intentionally and actively built their character to be the party's defender, leaving Marona room to focus on offense. Thus, she takes the Elemental Blast Ability to deal with crowds and Charge Up to give her an option to do a lot of burst damage.  

### Lessons  
Lessons represent passive or conditional alterations to a character's combat capabilities. They offer notable benefits when using certain types of Abilities or grant a benefit in specific circumstances.  
Lessons are described in more detail in [Chapter 7](#chapter-7-lessons). They cost 5 XP unless an exception is listed.  

> Marona wants to focus on elemental Abilities, so she takes the Elemental Attunement Lesson several times. By the time she's done she can deal Fire, Ice, Sky, and Earth damage. (Another player in her game focuses on dealing Dark damage, so she decides to save the XP for something else.) Once done with that, she also takes the Advantageous Recovery Lesson so that she gets extra benefits when striking a foe's Elemental Weakness.
> 
> Meanwhile XU-808 is spending most of their XP on other aspects of their character. They decide that the Resilient Protector Lesson is enough to represent XU-808's sturdiness in combat.  

### Utilities  
Utilities represent non-combat abilities that aid an adventurer. These may influence Skill rolls or grant new options that focus on non-combat applications. There is no limit on the number of Utilities a given character may purchase, and they each cost 3 XP (unless an exception is listed).  

Utilities are described in more detail in [Chapter 8](#chapter-8-utilities).  

> The first Utility XU-808 takes is Asceticism, reasoning that its benefits align with things a machine should be able to do anyway. Enhanced Sight also makes them better equipped to gather data for their scientific pursuits.  
> 
> Marona spends a lot of time delving in dungeons, and decides to take some Utilities to help in those situations. She starts with Speak with the Ancient Dead, allowing her to interrogate any corpses they find in their adventures. She also takes Whispered Wisdom so she can provide the party with extra information with her Lore check.  

### Talents  
Talents represent major modifications to your character’s abilities. They either apply more broadly or have much higher influence than Lessons. A character starts with one Talent and gains another when reaching a [Max Potential](#max-potential) divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15…). They come with the Max Potential increase and do not cost additional XP.  

Talents are described in more detail in [Chapter 9](#chapter-9-talents).  

> Upon reaching Max Potential 5, XU-808 immediately decides to pick the Flight talent, adding a jetpack to their arsenal.  
> 
> Meanwhile Marona wants more power in her build. Looking over the Talents, she decides to take Overwhelming Force, allowing her to add her Toughness to her Mental Offense, significantly boosting her damage output.  

------------
# Chapter 4: Abilities
Abilities represent actions your character is able to perform that are focused on combat.  

> <div align="center">=!=!=DISCLAIMER=!=!=</div>  

> The following section uses some terms defined in [Chapter 10](#chapter-10-combat). This handbook is laid out to keep everything you need to know about character creation in sequence. If to know details on how movement, spacing, and time works in combat you may want to skip ahead using the link above.  
> Two major things to keep in mind.  
> * Zones are large in S3 and can have multiple combatants in each Zone. Think of a Zone as an individual room or a room-sized region of a larger space. Abilities that list their target as a Zone target all creatures in that Zone. See [the Positioning section](#positioning) if you want more detail.  
> * Every Round you get a Minor, Major, and Counter Action to work with. You use the Minor and Major Actions during your Turn, and can use Counter Actions during other combatants' Turns in response to opponents' Actions.  

> <div align="center">=!=!=!=!=  </div>  

## Ability Tiers  
Abilities come in three tiers (currently).  

* Tier 0 Abilities are actions so basic that they don't require training to use; all characters can use all Tier 0 Abilities. These represent actions done with low skill or low effort.  
* Tier 1 Abilities represent entry level techniques; things that you have to learn or practice to do well. They can be taken at character creation. Characters start knowing 3 Tier 1 Abilities for free, and can purchase more Tier 1 Abilities for 3 XP.  
* Tier 2 Abilities represent more complex and specialized techniques which require significant experience before they can be mastered. You must reach [Hero Tier](hero-tier) 2 before you can take Tier 2 Abilities, and they cost 5 XP each.  

## Reading Abilities  

### Format  
Ability entries will follow this basic layout. (Fields that aren't relevant to a given Ability will be omitted.)  

**Ability Name**  
Type [Keywords]  
Action:  
Prerequisites:  
Range:  
Targets:  
Trigger:  
Cost: [Upkeep: ]  
Damage:  
Cooldown:  
Duration:  
Effect:  
Description:  

### Ability Type  
There are three types of Abilities.  

#### Attack  
Attack Abilities use [Physical Offense](#physical-offense) and are resisted by [Physical Defense](#physical-defense).  

#### Spell  
Spell Abilities use [Mental Offense](#mental-offense) and are resisted by [Mental Defense](#mental-defense).  

> Note that the term “Spell” is used here as a contrast to "Attack." During the game, Spell Abilities could also represent technology, chemistry, specialized anatomy, or anything else that might fit the game's setting.  

#### Auxiliary  
Auxiliary Abilities do not use offense rolls. They target yourself or your allies and do something to make it easier to fight.  

### Ability Keywords  
Some specific terms come with Abilities. These Keywords signify a related set of Abilities for the purposes of Lessons and Talents, or alter the way an Ability functions.  

#### Augment  
Abilities that strengthen allies. These will generally produce effects on the targets that have a Duration or Upkeep associated with them.  

#### Careful  
An Ability that can be made stronger by taking more time to do it. These require a Major Action, but have the option of using your Minor Action as well to improve them.  

#### Curse  
Abilities that leave a lingering weakening effect on the target when they hit. If the Ability has an Upkeep cost associated with it (see below) then the effect lasts as long as the Upkeep is paid. It otherwise lasts until it is dispelled with another Ability.  

#### Elemental  
Abilities that deal Elemental damage. Combatants can be Weak, Resistant, or Immune to Elements. Striking an opponent with an Element they are Weak to allows you to roll three dice during your Offense Roll, taking the **higher** two of the results. When striking an opponent with an Element they Resist you also roll three dice, but take the **lower** two results. Immune targets take no damage of that Element.  

The six elements are:  
* *Fire* - heat and flames  
* *Ice* - sharp icicles, freezing cold, or water  
* *Earth* - shards of rock, acid, and plant vines  
* *Sky* - electricity, wind blades, and the like  
* *Light* - radiance, blinding light, and holy power  
* *Dark* - draining away life essence, sharpened shadows, or unholy power  

When striking multiple targets with different Elemental Properties (such as with an area of effect Spell), first resolve all targets that are neither Resistant nor Weak to the element by rolling two ten-sided die as normal. After you have determined how much damage each of them receive, keep the results of those first two and roll the third die. Apply the highest two dice results against foes Weak to your chosen Element and the lowest two against Resistant foes.  
Extra dice rolled this way are affected by Boon and Bane normally. If you have to roll dice in two phases (as described in the previous paragraph), Boon or Bane triggered during the first phase (against elementally neutral targets) cannot/does not reroll the die rolled during the second phase.  

> For example, Anezka is using the Elemental Blast Ability with Ice Element. The Zone she targets has one foe that is Weak to Ice along with two that are neutral towards Ice. She also has Boon 4. 
> First, to damage the two neutral opponents she rolls the normal two dice, getting a 9 and a 4. She rerolls the 4 and gets a 1 (Boon backfires sometimes), so her final Result is 9 + 1 + her Mental Offense.  
> She now calculates damage for the Ice-weak target by rolling a third die, getting a 3. Since she used Boon to reroll the 4 earlier, she cannot reroll the 3. She still drops the lowest die, so for this foe her final result is 9 + 3 + her Mental Offense.  
>  
> Arbiters: I would advise you to use Immunity sparingly, make it intuitive when it happens, and pair it with Weaknesses. Obviously spirit composed entirely of flames wouldn't care about being burned, but if it's at all ambiguous cases I would advise using Resistance instead of Immunity.  

#### Guardian Strike  
Abilities with this Keyword allow a character to convert their defense into offense. If the Ability is an [Attack](#attack), the user may use Physical Defense - 10 in place of Physical Offense. If the Ability is a [Spell](#spell), the user may use Mental Defense - 10 in place of Mental Offense.  

#### Healing  
Abilities that restore HP.  

#### Status  
Abilities that afflict their target with a [Status Ailment](#status-ailment), effects that hinder foes. Status effects always have a Duration, and effects that would re-apply an Ailment already affecting the target extend its Duration by that much.  

### Action Requirement  
Whether the Ability is used with a Major, Minor, or Counter Action. See the [Time in Combat](#time-in-combat) section for details.

### Prerequisites  
If an Ability has a Prerequisite listed in its entry, you must fulfill the listed conditions before you are able to take that Ability. Usually this will be another Ability, representing related maneuvers building off of each other or more refined techniques. There are other things that could be prerequisites as well, such as [Skills](#skill-list).  

If at any time you no longer fulfill the prerequisites for a given Ability, you can no longer use it.  

### Range  
How far away you can be from your target(s). 
* None -  Targets you or your current Zone  
* Melee - Targets you or others in your current Zone  
* Short - Reaches up to 1 Zone  
* Medium - Reaches up to 3 Zones  
* Long - Reaches up to 5 Zones  
* Extreme - Reaches up to 8 Zones  

An Ability may also have a Minimum Range; such Abilities cannot affect targets that close or closer.  

### Targets  
Whether the Ability targets yourself, allies, enemies, or a Zone, and how many. (You count as your own ally for targeting purposes.)

### Trigger  
This is specific to [Counter Actions](#counters) and specifies what has to happen to be able to use the Ability.  

### Cost  
The HP or MP cost of using an Ability. If you cannot pay the Cost, you cannot use the Ability.  

#### Upkeep
Any Ability with an Upkeep in its Cost requires the listed HP or MP to be paid every [Round Start](#round-start). The Ability lasts as long as the Upkeep is paid or until some effect ends it prematurely (such as [Purge](#purge)). If the user is unable or unwilling to pay the Upkeep cost at Round Start, the Ability immediately ends. 

> Note: The separate Cost is paid when the Ability is first used, and the Upkeep cost is paid on all subsequent rounds.  
> For example, Drahlo uses the [Elemental Resistance Aura](#elemental-resistance-aura) Ability. Its cost is listed as "2 MP (Upkeep 1 MP)". This means that when he initially uses the Ability, he spends 2 MP. During the Round Start of all subsequent Rounds, he may choose to spend 1 MP to keep the aura active with no extra action investment from him.  
> There is no maximum to the number of Upkeep effects one character can maintain other than the resources needed to pay for them.  

### Damage  
The Ability's damage multiplier. The higher this number, the more damage the listed Ability can do. See [Impact](#impact) for more information on how damage works.  

### Cooldown  
If an Ability has a listed Cooldown, it cannot be used again until the specified number of Rounds have passed. Cooldowns decrease at [Round Start](#round-start).

# Chapter 6: Skills
Skills represent what your character is good at more broadly than Abilities. Skills are general purpose things and are usually rolled outside of combat (though they may come up in combat at times).  

Skill checks should only occur when there is some sort of pressure or danger present in a situation, or if the action being attempted is of non-trivial difficulty. For example, the Arbiter generally should not call for a Skill check to do something as trivial as climbing a ladder. However, if you're rushed, being attacked, the ladder is damaged and unstable, or under similar duress, you will need a Skill check. Doing something inherently dangerous, such as trying to climb a sheer cliff face, also requires a Skill check. For all of these examples, these checks would be a combination of Athletics, Acrobatics, with occasional Endure checks.  
Skills can also be used to answer questions about a related subject. For example, if you needed to know how much weight a pillar can bear, you can make a Construct check. To identify a song being played by someone else, roll a Performance check. To know the correct greeting in a formal situation in an unfamiliar land, make a Diplomacy check. To estimate the value of a pocket watch or a cut jewel you’ve found, make a Craft check.   

| Target number | Skill level          |
|---------------|----------------------|
| 5             | Trivial              |
| 10            | Easy                 |
| 15            | Moderately difficult |
| 20            | Very difficult       |
| 30            | Exceptional          |

## Skill Attributes
Each Skill has two associated Attributes. All skills of that type add those two Attributes to those Skill checks.  

## Skill Points  
You can spend Skill Points on each skill to raise its Base Bonus by 1. You start the game with 20 Skill Points to spend, and can purchase 5 Skill Points for 1 XP.  
The maximum number of Skill Points that can be invested into any one Skill is equal to your [Max Potential](#max-potential) + 3.  

### Helping Others
In situations where others need help with a skill you are well trained in, you can make the roll in their place. When you do this, you roll with half of your modifier. The character you are helping then treats that result as their own. Note that it is not always possible to help others with their checks.

### Raising the Stakes
You may choose to raise the target of a Skill check in order to get better results. If you do this, you fail the check if you don't meet the increased target, *even if you would have met the unaltered target*.  

Here are a few examples of modifications you can make. You and the Arbiter are encouraged to improvise additional possibilities.  

| Extra Effect            | Target Increase |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Look cool               | +1              |
| Use 25% fewer materials | +2              |
| Go 25% faster           | +3              |
| Get a superior result   | +5              |
| Look *extremely* cool   | +7              |

> Some examples:  
> Balam is climbing a rope ladder in a storm. The Athletics/Acrobatics target is 15. He wants to do it extra fast, so the Arbiter lets him increase that to 18.    
> Dr. Skren is working on a cybernetic arm for a friend. Normally this tech requires a Science or Tech check of 20, but she wants this to be extra powerful and cranks that target up to 25. If it works she gets a hell of an arm, but on failure the materials and time are wasted.

# Chapter 7: Lessons
Broadly speaking, Lessons represent passive combat benefits or extra options available to someone trained in specific style of combat. Some Lessons will list prerequisites; if that is the case then you must meet these prerequisites to be able to take the Lesson, and if you ever fail to meet those prerequisites you gain no benefit from the associated Lesson.  
Lessons cost 5 XP unless an exception is listed. Cooldowns on Lessons function the same way as [Ability Cooldowns](#cooldown).  

#### A Curse Most Foul  
When using a Curse Ability, you may choose one or both of the following benefits.
* If the Curse costs HP, you may spend MP instead. If it costs MP, you may spend HP instead.
* The victim of your Curse also takes damage equal to half of your [Offense](#step-2-b-offensedefense). Use Physical Offense if the Ability is an Attack, or Mental Offense if the Ability is a Spell.

> Reminder: all fractions round down. If your Offense is 5, then you add 2 damage when using the section benefit.

#### Ability Specialist  
Choose one Ability you already know. When you use that Ability, you may gain one of the following benefits:  
* Increase the Ability's Range by one increment. (So Melee Range becomes Short, Short becomes Medium, etc. Abilities that are already Extreme Range cannot use this benefit.)  
* Reduce the cost of the Ability (whether HP or MP) by your Hero Tier. This only applies to initial costs; this has no effect on Upkeep.  
* If the Ability is an Attack or Spell, you gain Boon 2 on Offense rolls with it.  

You choose which benefit you gain every time you use the Ability and may choose different benefits on different rounds.  
You may take this Lesson once per Hero Tier, choosing a different Ability each time.  

#### Advantageous Recovery  
When you strike a foe’s elemental weakness, you regain MP equal to half your [Base  Magic Offense](#base-physicalmental-offensedefense), up to a maximum equal to the MP used to perform the striking Ability. This Lesson can only be activated once per Ability use; striking multiple foes with one Ability cannot restore HP or MP more than once.

#### Aggressive Provocation  
When you target an opponent you have [Provoked](#provoke) with an Attack or Spell, you may apply [Guardian Strike](#guardian-strike) If you're using and Ability that strikes multiple opponents, use your Offense bonus as normal for foes you have not Provoked.  

#### Anger  
Whenever you receive damage you may enter an Enraged state. Spending HP to use an Ability or any effect described as “lose life” (such as losing HP due to low Endurance during a chase) does not count as damage. Damage from any source can activate Anger. While Enraged, your Physical and Mental Offense increases by 2, but your Physical and Mental Defense decreases by 3. If you end your Turn without having received damage since the end of your previous Turn, you are no longer Enraged.

#### Ataraxia  
Prerequisite: [Brace](#brace)  
While [rooted](#root), you may reduce the MP cost of any Spells you cast by their [Ability Tier](#ability-tiers) (to a minimum of 0).  

#### Combo Striker
Every time you successfully hit an opponent with a single target Melee or Short range Attack, you gain one Combo point. Each Combo point gives you Boon +1 on subsequent Attacks, to a maximum of your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) plus 1. If you miss with an Attack, change targets, or fail to use a Short or Melee range Attack on your current target during your Turn, you lose all Combo points.  
Abilities that can optionally target multiple foes (such as [Double Strike](#double-strike)) can be used with Combo Striker, but only if a single foe is chosen for all effects.  

#### Curse Resistant  
Curse Abilities that target you do so at Bane -2.

#### Elemental Attunement  
When you gain this Lesson, pick one of the following: Fire, Cold, Sky, Earth, Light, or Dark. Whenever you use an Ability with the [Elemental] tag, you may chose to deal damage of the corresponding type.  
Special: You may take this Lesson more than once, choosing a different element each time. The first time you gain an Ability with the [Elemental] tag, you also automatically gain Elemental Attunement for free once.  
Every instance of this Lesson costs 3 XP.  

#### First to Act  
Increase your [Initiative bonus](#initiative-bonus) by twice your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier). You also gain Boon +2 on Initiative rolls.

#### Fortifying Voice  
When you target creatures with an Augment, all affected gain [Shield](#shield-x) equal to your [Mental Defense](#mental-defense) - 10.

#### Hit and Run  
Once per Turn when you use a melee range Attack, you can move 1 Zone as part of the Attack. You can do this before or after making the Attack. This Lesson has [Cooldown](#cooldown) 3.

#### Melee Mage  
When using a Spell that normally has a range of Medium or better against a foe who is within Melee range of you, you may reduce the MP cost by its [Ability Tier](#ability-tiers) (to a minimum of 0).

#### Lingering Provocation  
Any time you [Provoke](#provoke) a target, that Provocation lasts for 2 rounds.

Whenever you spend MP to cast a damaging Spell, you may increase the MP cost by the Spell's tier. If you do, add your [Capacity](#vitalitycapacity) to your damage. This extra damage is not included in multipliers.

> Example: Merlin has the Manamaim Lesson, Capacity 4, and casts Elemental Lance with the Overload cost. His opponent has Mental Defense 12, and his Offense total is 17. The [Impact](#impact) is 5, and with the Overload cost paid Elemental Lance has a x2 multiplier. This results in 10 damage, plus 4 from Manamaim, resulting in 14 damage.

#### Manamend
Whenever us an Ability that heals HP damage, you may increase the MP cost by the Ability's tier. If you do, add your [Capacity](#vitalitycapacity) to the total healing done.

#### Masochism  
Any time you spend HP to use an Attack or Spell, you gain [Shield](#shield-x) equal to the spent health that lasts until your next Turn.

#### Mend or Rend  
On the turn after using an Auxiliary Ability with the Healing tag, you gain Boon +2 on all Short or Melee Range Attacks.  
On the turn after using a Short or Melee Range Attack, your Auxiliary Abilities with the Healing tag heal additional HP equal to twice your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).  

#### Nerves of Steel  
Reduce the duration of any action that makes you [Afraid](#afraid) by 1 Round. If this reduces the effect to 0 Rounds, the action fails outright.  

#### Overcharge  
If your healing would bring your target above maximum HP, the target gains [Shield](#shield-x) to the excess. Targets can only have one Shield from this Lesson; if a larger Shield would be applied by this Lesson, the smaller one fades immediately. The Shield also fades at the start of your next Turn.

#### Oppressor  
When you knock a foe [Prone](#prone), they are not able to stand again if you are in the same Zone as them. The effect lasts one round per [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).

* Your target is [Rooted](#root) until your next Turn.  

Upon using this Lesson, it goes on [Cooldown](#cooldown) for 3 Rounds.  

#### Resilient Protector  
While you have [Taunt](#taunt) and are in the same space as an ally, are providing an ally with [Protection](#protection), or are being targeted by an opponent you have [Provoked](#provoke), increase your Physical and Mental Defense by 1. This benefit does not apply when using your Defense in place of an Offense roll, such as when using [Demand](#demand).

When you pay an Upkeep cost in MP, you heal for that much HP.

# Chapter 8: Utilities
Broadly, Utilities are things your character can do that are not related to combat. There is no limit to the number of Utilities a character can have. Unless otherwise stated, Utilities cost 3 XP. 
 
## Skill-based Utilities
> Note: the skill bonuses on these skill-based Utilities are NOT [Skill Points](#skill-points) and are added ON TOP OF the character's Base Skill Bonus.  
> For example, Elaahni wants to maximize her [Empathy](#empathy) checks. She is [Max Potential](#max-potential) 6, and has Heart 2 and Soul -1. She has purchased enough Skill Points to max her Base Skill Bonus at 6. 6 + 2 - 1 = 7. She also purchases the [Natural Intuition](#natural-intuition) and [Whispered Wisdom](#whispered-wisdom) Utilities, each of which increase her Empathy modifier by 1 more each. This gives her a total Empathy bonus of 9.

#### 1337 H4xx0r  
Increase your [Tech](#tech) and [Sabotage](#sabotage) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, when you break into a software system with your Tech skill, you may choose one of the following.  
* Logging: You leave a logger in the compromised system. This allows you to read all messages sent through or with the system.  
* Framing: You can plant files into the specified system.  
* Crashing: You can cause the system to crash. You can delay this crash for a specified amount of time, or set up the crash to occur under specific circumstances. Examples could be crashing when a given user logs in, upon visiting a given website, or when you set off a remote signal.  
* Trolling: You can cause the system to play loud music or videos, the nature of which is up to the hacker and should be calculated for maximum psychological damage.  
Record the result of the Tech check that originally gets you into the system. Anyone searching for your meddling can do so by rolling an Investigation or Tech check equal to or greater than this check.  

#### Asceticism  
Increase your [Composure](#composure) and [Endure](#endure) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you can go 2 weeks without food or water with no ill effect, no need to make Endure checks. When you sleep, you enter a state of meditation and are still aware of the world around yourself. This enables you to awaken with full lucidity instantly and to make Awareness checks while sleeping without penalty.  

#### Credentialed Academic  
Increase your [Endure](#endure) and your choice of [History](#history), [Lore](#lore), [Medicine](#medicine), [Nature](#nature), [Science](#science), or [Tech](#tech) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you have studied a topic related to the chosen field extensively. Your modifier in that field increases by an additional 3. You also have documents affirming your expertise. Finally, you have access to an academic venue willing to re-issue said documents if they are lost or destroyed and connections with other academics in that venue. Discuss the implications of this Utility with your Arbiter when you take it so both of you are able to apply this should it come up in your game.  

| Chosen Skill | Example Specializations                                                   |  
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| History      | A country, organization, culture, language, or time period                |  
| Lore         | A religion, philosophy, folklore, or esoteric system                      |  
| Medicine     | Anatomy, disease, a field of treatment, psychology, diagnostics           |  
| Nature       | Botany, zoology, veterinarian training, agriculture, a specific ecosystem |  
| Science      | Astronomy, physics, geology, chemistry, biology                           |  
| Tech         | Algorithms, computer science, information security, mathematics           |  

> This Utility is intended for characters who have legitimately done the research and earned these credentials. Characters who have forged their documents or who got their academic positions through nepotism or skulduggery aren't covered here.  
> I promise you: everyone who has made it through academia understands the Endure bonus.  

#### Dangerous Aura  
Increase your [Diplomacy](#diplomacy) and [Intimidation](#intimidation) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you have a presence or air about you that leaves no doubt about your familiarity with violence. You inspire fear in most, gaining Boon +3 on Intimidation checks made against NPCs with no combat training. Meanwhile you inspire respect in fellow fighters, gaining Boon +3 on Diplomacy checks made with them.  

#### Eidetic Memory
Increase your [History](#history) and [Lore](#lore) modifiers by 1.  
You are able to reliably remember information correctly. You may ask the Arbiter for clarification on things the character remembers but the player may not, and the Arbiter will give an accurate answer. This includes things like dates, times, names, articles in magazines, newspapers, or online.

> Player, ask the Arbiter before taking this Utility; this puts a lot more pressure on the Arbiter to remember everything. Both the Arbiter and the player should be open to improvising and hand-waving if the Arbiter misremembers, and the player should do their best to help this Utility along by taking notes of things they may remember.

#### Enhanced Sight  
Increase your [Awareness](#awareness) and [Investigation](#investigation) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you are unaffected by low or no light conditions. This could represent extremely acute hearing, access to infrared goggles, being able to cast a spell that lets one see in darkness, or other means of bypassing darkness. This does not significantly impact your ability to be seen in darkness like carrying a flashlight would.  
You are also able to see clearly up to a distance of 6 miles.

#### Extraordinary Saboteur  
Increase your [Sabotage](#sabotage) and [Stealth](#stealth) modifier by 1.  
You can set Traps. This could represent a tripwire, a pressure plate, a laser scanner, or something similar.  
You may set one Trap for every 5 Base Sabotage bonus (so 1 Trap at 5 Sabotage, 2 Traps at 10 Sabotage, and so on). Setting a Trap requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work. If you are interrupted during this time you must start over.  
Detecting your Trap requires an [Awareness](#awareness) check equal to your Sabotage bonus +10. Disabling or bypassing it requires a Sabotage check at the same target. You may disable and recover the components of your own Traps safely, and anyone you make aware of your Traps may bypass them safely.  
Each Trap you set can have 2 of the following attributes.  
* When the Trap goes off, everyone within a 300' radius knows. A bang, explosion, alarm, fireworks, or something similar occurs so everyone nearby knows the location of whoever set the Trap off.  
* The creature who set it off becomes locked in place. This could be a bear trap, a net or lasso, a pit, or something similar. The target is entitled to an [Acrobatics](#acrobatics) or [Athletics](#athletics) check equal to your Sabotage bonus + 10. On success they break free. On a failure they are [Rooted](#root) for an hour or until they receive assistance.  
* The target is damaged. When the Trap goes off you deal damage equal to a Sabotage check multiplied by 2. Every time you increase in [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) this multiplier increases by 1 (so x3 at Hero Tier 2, x4 at Hero Tier 3, and so on.) This damage is reduced by an amount equal to the target's Physical or Mental Defense, chosen when you set the Trap. This damage is either physical or of an element you have from [Elemental Attunement](#elemental-attunement).  
* The target is Injured. When you set the Trap, choose which [Attribute](#step-1-attributes) is Injured. If you choose Vitality, Strength, Finesse, or Toughness, the target can make an [Endure](#endure) check to negate the Injury. If you choose Capacity, Mind, Heart, or Soul, the check is [Composure](#composure) instead.  
If you set a Trap that exceeds your limit above, your oldest Trap deactivates.

#### Familiar Bond
Increase the modifier of any one Skill by 1.  
You can summon or create a familiar to help with mundane tasks outside of combat. This could be a small animal bonded to you, an automaton you’ve built, an object you’ve infused with life, or something similar. This familiar never participates in combat, hiding away where they will not be harmed. (For simplicity’s sake, you do not need to track the familiar during combat.) The familiar fetches objects, helps keep living areas tidy, can stand watch while your party rests, and other simple, non-violent tasks. If required to make a Skill check, the Familiar’s core stats are as follows:  
Strength -1, Finesse 1, Toughness 0, Mind 1, Heart 1, Soul 1  
Summoning a familiar is a ritual that requires an hour of uninterrupted work. This could be praying to nature spirits to send an ally, invoking the spirits of the dead to bind to a vessel, tinkering with clockwork components, or similar activities. If a familiar takes any damage at all, it immediately dies. The ritual for reviving a dead familiar or obtaining a new one is the same as acquiring the first one.  
You may take this Utility up to 3 times, gaining a new Familiar and Skill boost each time. A given Skill can only be increased by Familiar Bond once.  

#### Gangster's Cant  
Increase your [Deception](#deception) and [Streetwise](#streetwise) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you have learned the secret language of the criminal underworld. This allows you to understand signs and symbols to guide you to where such people gather and speak their language. A conversation spoken in Cant is impossible to follow without this knowledge.  

#### Mountain Climber  
Increase your [Acrobatics](#acrobatics) and [Athletics](#athletics) modifiers by 1.  
You are acclimated to high elevations and can survive at high altitudes without penalty. You have Boon +4 on all checks made to climb a slope or wall or maintain your grip on a ledge.

#### Natural Intuition  
Increase your [Diplomacy](#diplomacy) and [Empathy](#empathy) modifiers by 1.  
When you successfully detect that someone is lying to you with an Empathy check, you automatically gain a small insight into their motivations. This comes as a single word. Some examples:
* The target is being blackmailed by someone who can ruin their lives, forced to work against the party. “Fear”
* The target is a petty conman and just wants to score some easy coin off the party. “Greed”
* The party includes an elf, the target is an orc, and there is still long standing, mutual dislike between elves and orcs since a war between them two decades ago. “History”
* The target is secretly after revenge against someone in the party. “Enmity”

#### Poker Face  
Increase your [Composure](#composure) and [Deception](#deception) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you may use Composure to completely mask your emotional state, and you gain Boon +4 to do so. (This is only for concealing information; for actively misleading someone you would still need to use Deception.)

#### Specialist Artisan  
Increase your [Construct](#construct) and [Craft](#craft) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, choose a specialized type of crafting to specialize in. You produce items from within that specialization at double the normal pace and can presume you have materials and tools necessary to do basic repairs on items from that specialization at all times and/or are able to recycle existing items to gain those materials. You have Boon +2 on all Construct or Craft checks involving your specialization.  
For Construct, specializations could include metal working, masonry, carpentry, heavy machinery, or similar specializations.  
For Craft, specializations could include tailoring, jewel crafting, leather working, clockwork and tinkering, leather working, and the like.

#### Stationary Stealth  
Increase your [Endure](#endure) and [Stealth](#stealth) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you are an expert at staying stealthy when still. If you have not moved within the last 10 seconds (1 round of combat), you gain Boon +4 on Stealth checks. For the purposes of this Lesson, 'moving' refers to moving to different Zones; small shifts in position or posture do not remove this benefit.

#### Tracking Bug  
Increase your [Sabotage](#sabotage) and [Survival](#survival) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you can plant a Bug on a target to keep track of them. If you get within Long distance, you can attempt to plant your Bug by making a Survival or Sabotage check (your choice) against your opponent's [Awareness](#awareness) or [Stealth](#stealth) check (target's choice). If you fail on the initial attempt, the target notices your attempt to track them. They may choose to stop you from planting the Bug and confront you immediately, or to leave it in place.  
If you succeed, you plant your Bug on the target. While the Bug is active, you can sense the distance and direction of the Bug. At [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) 1, the Bug lasts 1 day. This duration doubles every time you increase in Hero Tier (2 days, 4 days, 8 days, ...).  
If your target fails to notice your initial attempt to Bug them, the target (or one of their allies) might find it later when changing clothes and/or looking through their things; when this happen, the Arbiter should either call for an Awareness or [Investigation](#investigation) check, or roll one for the searching character privately. The target for this check is 10 + your Survival or Sabotage modifier. For both the check and the target, use whichever Skill the participants are better at. On success, the target becomes aware of your Bug. On a failure, the Bug remains hidden. At least four hours must pass before the check can be attempted again.  
Every time you act against the target or give a sign that you're following them, reduce the target to find the Bug by 1. This includes actions like ambushing them, leaving traps for them, failing to cover your tracks when trying to cut them off, or other similar actions at the Arbiter's discretion.  
Once your Bug has been discovered, it can be easily destroyed. A discovered Bug might also be used to lure the individual that planted it into a trap.  
This could represent a tracking spell, a hidden homing beacon, a literal insect leaving a pheromone trail, or similar means of  a target from a distance.  

#### Trackless Traversal  
Increase your [Stealth](#stealth) and [Survival](#survival) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you and up to three allies may travel without leaving any sort of trail. Survival and Investigation checks made to follow you are made at Bane -4. Every additional traveler decreases the Bane severity by 1 (Bane -3 with four allies, Bane -2 with five, ...) This may represent using survival techniques to mask your tracks along with concoctions to mask your scent, activating boots that leave no trails, casting a spell of safe passage, or similar measures.  

#### Versatile Pilot
Increase your [Construct](#construct) and [Drive](#drive) modifiers by 1. (Choose one vehicle for Drive.)  
In addition, you can pilot a second vehicle with the same Drive modifier. For example, you could make your proficiency in horseback riding also apply to driving a chariot, or be equally skilled in riding a hoverboard and driving a car.

#### Well Connected  
Increase your [Diplomacy](#diplomacy) and [Streetwise](#streetwise) modifiers by 1.  
In addition, you can assume you have connections in any non-trivial settlement you travel to. This can be the result of celebrity status, being a member of a well known and respected organization, or just having a lot of friends (or friends of friends) around the realm. This person should be generally friendly and/or sympathetic to your cause (within reason) and familiar with the customs of the region. Beyond that, your connections’ details are up to the Arbiter. Discuss the ramifications of this Connection with the Arbiter before taking it so they can prepare appropriately. When coming to a new location, you can ask the Arbiter who your connection is and what you know about them.

#### Whispered Wisdom  
Increase your [Empathy](#empathy) and [Lore](#lore) modifiers by 1.  
You can also glean information about locations or events intuitively. This can be consulting with spirits of the area, unlocking the memories of objects in the vicinity, getting brief glimpses of the past or future, consulting an advanced AI, and other ways one might gather small bits of information. You may conduct a ritual that takes at least one minute. Afterwards make a Lore check, the difficulty of which is determined secretly by the Arbiter. If you succeed, you can get a clear yes/no answer or a short, often cryptic phrase to guide you. If you fail, there will be no answer.  
To determine the difficulty of the Lore check, the Arbiter should consider several factors. How obscure is the topic being asked about? If it’s about a location, was it the location of significant events? Are there forces at work trying to keep the information hidden? If it’s about a person, how powerful are they? Powerful individuals are more difficult to learn about through this feature.   
After performing the ritual, you cannot do so again for the next eight hours. You cannot do this ritual again in the same place until either a year has passed, or you permanently increase your Lore modifier by 2.

## Other Utilities 

#### Aquatic  
You are able to function better under water. You can breathe water, are able to move through calm water effortlessly, and have Boon 4 on checks made to swim through turbulent water.

> In some settings where straight up water breathing isn't really viable for the PCs--for example, a game that takes place in a modern setting with only human characters--this Utility could instead represent access to oxygen tanks and gear for going underwater for at least 2 hours.

#### Hover  
You can fly up to five feet off the ground.  
This could represent wings that don’t quite have the strength to fully fly, a personal anti-gravity field, a spell that produces a hovering platform, or something similar.  
While not as versatile as fully functioning flight, this allows to you avoid hazards on the floor, reach a ledge that is otherwise too tall to get to, and any other advantage one could imagine comes with being slightly airborne.  
This does not protect you from falling damage; if you are suddenly more than five above the ground you will fall as normal.
This Lesson makes you immune to natural terrain effects.  
In addition, you are able to reduce the damage you take when falling by half.


#### Linguist  
You learn a language. This can represent doing scholarship and lessons just as well as a background living in a multilingual culture.  
You may take this Utility twice at first [Max Potential](#max-potential), plus once more per Max Potential.  

#### Lip reading  
You can read lips, i.e. if you are close enough to see a creature's face while it speaks, you know what they are saying. 

#### One with Nature: Animals  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with animals. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you gain a basic understanding of animal speech.  
Animals have simple, instinctual desires and are usually very focused on the here and now. Most quickly dismiss past events that don’t affect their ability to survive and don’t really understand “the future” as a concept.  

#### One with Nature: Minerals  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with minerals. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you have learned to tap into a subtle consciousness that is present in stone, metal, and gems.  
Minerals have long memories, but no ability to move and thus a very limited frame of reference. They also have a difficult time telling moving things apart; seeking information about a specific person while speaking to stone is unlikely to be fruitful unless no one else has passed by in a very long time.  
You may only use this method of communication to speak with unworked minerals. The process of cutting gems for jewelry or forging metal for equipment “kills” the materials, rendering them silent to you.

#### One with Nature: Plants  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with plants. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you can hear the thoughts of plants from the smallest weed to the largest tree.  
If they are getting adequate resources to grow, plants are generally pleasant conversationalists, often talking about weather patterns or similar topics. Trees will discuss the lives of the animals living within their branches, and grasses will talk about grazers coming for them and being stepped on.

#### Sixth Sense  
XP Cost: 5  
You have a innate ability to sense supernatural influences. This can be angelic, demonic, undead, fey, eldritch, or anything between. When you focus your senses, you can detect if a supernatural being is within thirty feet of you. You know the creature’s general location and what sort of creature it is. You can also sense when supernatural forces have tampered with otherwise natural processes in a residual way.

#### Speak with the Ancient Dead  
XP Cost: 5  
Prerequisite: [Speak with the Recently Dead](#speak-with-the-recently-dead)  
Your ability to speak with corpses improves; now all that is required is an intact skull. The state of the rest of the body does not matter.

#### Speak with the Recently Dead  
You can speak with corpses. The corpses know everything they knew in life, up until the last day of their lives, which they completely forget. Corpses in this state have no emotions, and cannot learn new information, including the fact that they are dead. They also cannot move. The corpse must still have enough lungs and vocal cords to be able speak, or this Utility fails. This could be harnessing necromancy, utilizing nanobots to reconstruct what the body's brain knew, being an effective medium, knowledge of certain rituals, or similar measures.

#### Speak with the Recently Dead, Improved  
XP Cost: 7  
Prerequisite: [Speak with the Recently Dead](#speak-with-the-recently-dead), [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) 2  
You can learn more from corpses; corpses you speak with in this way now remember everything the knew up to the moment of their death. If you also have [Speak with the Ancient Dead](#speak-with-the-ancient-dead) this effect extends to them.

------------

# Chapter 9: Talents
A character gains a Talent for free at [Max Potential](#max-potential) 1, and again when gaining a Max Potential divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15, ...).

#### Accelerated Assistance
When you use an Augment ability, you can also do one of the following:  
* Double the cost of the Ability to use it on another target without spending an Action.  
* Use an Augment Ability that normally costs a Major Action to a Minor Action. If you do this, you can only use one Augment on this round.  

When you gain this talent, you also learn either [Empower](#empower) or [Fortify](#fortify). If you have already learned both, you may refund the XP spent to learn one of them.

#### Battering Defense
You can physically batter aside your opponent's attacks. You may use your Strength in place of Toughness to determine your Physical Defense.

#### Body and Soul  
Your wholeness of spirit leads to wholeness of body. You may use your Soul in place of Strength to determine your HP.

#### Cascading Curses  
When you successfully strike a target with a Curse Ability, you can also do one of the following:  
* Double the cost of the Ability to use it on another target without spending an Action.  
* Use a non-Curse Attack or Spell Ability that normally requires a Major Action as a Minor Action. This Ability may not be of a higher Tier than the Curse that triggers this Talent, and must have the same target as the Curse that triggered this.  

When you gain this Talent, you also learn either [Enfeeble](#enfeeble) or [Expose](#expose). If you have already learned both, you may refund the XP spent to learn one of them.

#### Crushing Zeal  
Your attacks are powered by your spirit. You may use your Heart in place of Finesse to determine your Physical Offense and Initiative.

#### Elemental Specialist  
Choose one element: Fire, Cold, Sky, Earth, Light, or Dark. You gain the following benefits:  
* You gain [Elemental Attunement](#elemental-attunement) for the associated element.  
  * If you already have Elemental Attunement for the chosen element, you may either gain Elemental Attunement with a new element, or regain the 3 XP invested in gaining Elemental Attunement originally.
* You gain resistance to the chosen element.
  * If the chosen element was previously your weakness, you must choose a new element to be your weakness.
* If you spend an additional 1 MP per tier of the Ability you are using, you may convert physical damage you do into the chosen element.  
  * Tier 0 Abilities require no additional cost to convert.
  * Your converted damage still targets the usual Physical or Mental Defense.
* You gain an additional benefit unique to each element as follows
  * Fire - Successfully dealing Fire damage also inflicts [Degeneration](#degeneration) for 2 rounds, to a maximum of 6 rounds. Every time you increase in Hero Tier, the Degeneration added per hit increases by 1 round, and the maximum duration increases by 2 rounds.  
  * Cold - Successfully dealing Cold damage also [slows](#slow) the target for 2 rounds. If you successfully deal Cold damage to a target that is already slowed, they instead become [rooted](#root) for 1 round.
  * Sky - You may move before or after using an Ability that deals Sky damage. You must end your movement such that you still are within the triggering Ability's range to the target.
  * Earth - Successfully scoring a [Solid Hit](#solid-hit) while dealing Earth damage allows you to move the target one Zone.
  * Light - Successfully dealing Light damage allows you give [shield](#shield-x) to an ally within the triggering Ability's range. The magnitude of this shield is equal to half the damage done.  
  * Dark - Successfully dealing Dark damage restores you for half the damage done. If you do HP damage you heal that amount, and if you do MP damage you restore that much MP.   
Note that to gain these benefits, the damage must be done by you personally. If using the Summoning module, your summoned allies do not benefit from this Talent.

#### Everlasting  
At the [Round End](#round-end) of every Turn, you regain HP equal to your [Vitality](#vitalitycapacity). When you gain this Talent, you also gain one point of Vitality without paying the XP cost.

If you ever reach zero HP, you cease regaining HP until you are given healing from another source.  

#### Flight Talent  
Your maneuverability allows you to overcome gravity, be it through magical power, transmuting wings for yourself, equipping and successfully piloting a jet-pack, or similar means of propulsion. You gain the [Flight](#flight) property.  
This Talent makes the [Hover](#hover) Utility redundant. If you previously took the Hover Utility, you lose it but regain the XP spent.

#### Healing Hands  
You are an expert healer. When you use an Ability with the [Healing] tag, you may gain one of the following benefits:
* End a Curse effect on the target.
* Increase the target along one [Buff Track](#buff-tracks) of your choice. You can only increase the value up to 0.
* Reduce the duration of one [Status Ailment](#status-ailments) the target is suffering from by 2 rounds.

#### Heavy Hitter  
You hit so hard that you can knock your foes around without actively trying to. When you make an Attack or Spell and get a [Critical Hit](#critical-hit), you can choose one of the following extra effects.
* Knock your target(s) [Prone](#prone).  
* [Stagger](#stagger) your target(s) for a number of rounds equal to your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).  
* Move your target(s) one Zone. In the case of multiple targets, you must move them all in the same direction.  

You may only affect a given target with this Talent once per Turn. If you strike multiple Critical Hits with a single action (such as using an Ability that targets a Zone) you must choose the same effect for all creatures affected. You cannot affect a target with Heavy Hitter due to an Offense Roll that doesn't come with an Attack or Spell, such as maintaining a [Grab](#grab) or similar effect.  
This Talent also reduces the effect of the [Size](https://github.com/Proven-Paradox/shaper-system/blob/main/Adversaries-and-Monsters.md#size-x) quality on enemies by your Hero Tier. This is a passive effect that applies to all Attacks and Spells, not just Critical Hits.  

#### Intelligent Avoidance  
You’ve mastered how to avoid attacks by predicting their path. You may use your Mind in place of Finesse to determine your Physical Defense.

#### Lucky
You're just lucky sometimes. 
You may reroll a number of dice equal to 2 + your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier). Your rerolls refresh after you spend six hours not using any. You still cannot reroll dice that have already been rerolled, either through this Talent or through Boon/Bane.  
When you roll [Matches](#matches), you may gain one additional dice reroll.  
When you reroll dice due to Boon, you may keep the higher result between the two instead of replacing the previous roll.  

#### Mana Fountain
You gain 9 additional MP, plus 3 more for each point of [Capacity](#vitalitycapacity). This Talent applies retroactively to all levels of Capacity. When you gain this Talent, you also gain a point of Capacity without paying the XP cost.

#### Measured Strikes  
You practice a fighting style that emphasizes mind over muscle. You may use your Mind in place of Strength to determine your Physical Offense.

#### Muscle Mage  
You have trained in a magic style that uses strength of body over strength of mind. You may use your Strength in place of Mind to determine your MP.

#### Overwhelming Force  
You can draw magic power from your physical vitality. You may use your Toughness in place of Soul to determine your Mental Offense and Initiative.

#### Perfect Protector  
At the start of your turn in combat, you may choose one of the following benefits. The chosen benefit happens automatically and does not require an action from you. You do not pay any MP or HP costs to use these options.
* Gain [Taunt](#taunt).  
* Use [Cover](#cover) on one Ally in your Zone.  
* Use [Demand](#demand) on one Enemy within Medium range. (You may use this option even if you have not learned the Demand Ability.)

#### Precise Evasion  
You are able to avoid spells with agility. You may use your Finesse in place of Soul to determine your Mental Defense.

#### Serene Capacity  
You are able to power your spells with intuition and patience. You may use your Soul in place of Heart to determine your MP.

#### Skill Spell  
You make your spells more deadly by striking with superior control and aim. You may use your Finesse in place of Mind to determine your Mental Offense.

#### Sturdy Shield  
You can use your physical sturdiness to protect yourself against mental forces. You may use your Toughness in place of Heart to determine your Mental Defense.

#### Unyielding Confidence  
You can keep yourself going with sheer willpower. You may use your Heart in place of Toughness to determine your HP.

# Chapter 10: Combat  
Combat is frequently part of an exciting story. While not every story needs combat, often conflict escalates until it cannot be solved peacefully. This chapter presents rules for handling fights.  

## Surprise/Ambush  
The Arbiter determines who might be surprised in a given scenario. It might involve [Awareness](#awareness) checks against [Stealth](#stealth), but different situations may call for different rolls to see if someone gets an opportunity to strike the first blow. If a creature is surprised, it doesn’t act in the first Round of combat and is treated as [Flat Footed](#flat-footed).  

## Time in Combat  
Actions in combat are organized into Rounds (10 seconds in game) in which each combatant takes a Turn.  

Each Round is broken down into three phases.

### Round Start  
At the start of every Round, everyone pays the Upkeep of any ongoing Abilities, reduce the counter on Abilities that have Cooldowns, as well as any Abilities or effects with limited Duration. If a Character used their Counter Action (see below) the previous Round, they regain it at Round Start.  

> It can be helpful when running fights to get one of the players to keep up with everything that needs to happen at Round Start, at least for the players' side.  

### Turn Taking  
Each Round, every combatant takes a turn. The order participants take their individual Turns in is determined by an Initiative roll at the start of combat. Everyone rolls normally, adding their [Initiative Bonus](#initiative-bonus). The person with the highest result goes first, followed by the next highest, and so on until everyone has had a Turn.  

#### Your Turn  
When your Turn comes, you get two Actions to work with: one Major and one Minor. Abilities list their Action requirements in their descriptions. Things such as speaking or movements that don’t meaningfully change the state of the fight do not require an Action. You are not required to use both of your Actions.  

#### Counters  
Between your Turns, you have one Counter Action. Some Abilities allow you to use this action to do something that interrupts or responds to another combatant's Turn. Abilities that requires a Counter Action will list a trigger condition that must be fulfilled before the action can be used.  

### Round End  
At this step you return to Round Start for the next round. Some Abilities, Lessons, and Talents add additional steps to the Round End, unique to each character.  

> When it’s not your Turn, you should be considering what your next action is going to be. Just because someone else is doing the talking doesn’t mean you should stop thinking. Actively planning your Turn during your friends’ actions means the game will be faster and more fun for everyone.  

```  
TODO refactor into better "How to do damage" section, figure out how to work  
Buff Tracks into this chapter better; high priority  
```  

## Impact  
To make an Offense roll, first you roll your 2 dice as normal and add your modifier. If the Ability you are using to strike is labeled as an Attack, you use Physical Offense. Abilities labeled as Spells instead add your Mental Offense. Once you have this result, subtract your target’s Defense: Physical Defense for Attacks and Mental Defense for Spells. (There are exceptions for some Abilities, such as [Elemental Strike](#elemental-strike)). The result is called the Impact. If the Impact is above zero, your Ability has landed and will affect your opponent. Usually this will mean dealing damage, but some abilities instead impose conditions or something else unpleasant when they land. The amount of damage you deal is determined by multiplying your Impact by the Ability’s damage multiplier.

> Note that the term "Spell" is used as a term to differentiate from physical and mental strikes. An Ability listed as a Spell can function due to magic, technology, equipment, or similar sources.

### Solid Hit  
Any Attack or Spell Impact that is 5 or higher is considered a Solid Hit. This by itself has no implicit effect, but some Abilities, Lessons, etc. may confer additional benefits on a Solid Hit.

### Critical Hit  
Like Solid Hits, a Critical Hit is any Attack or Spell with an Impact of 10 or higher. This doesn't have any inherent effect (though it is likely going to be very painful for the target) but may activate other effects from Abilities, Lessons, etc.

### Matches
Any time your dice rolls comes up on the same number, that is considered a Match. Like Solid and Critical Hits, this has no significant implication by itself, but may cause something to happen due to other effects on the character.

## Buff Tracks  
These are a way of measuring advantage or disadvantage in Offense or Defense. Unless you are in conditions that specify otherwise, you start every combat at level 0 in both tracks. Several different Abilities can affect this track, which provides appropriate benefits or downsides to every character in a unified way.  

### The Offensive Track  
* **Level 3** - You make Offense rolls at Boon +4, and your Abilities that require Offense rolls cost 1 less HP or MP per Hero Tier. This cannot take an Ability’s cost below 1.  
* **Level 2** - You make Offense rolls at Boon +3.  
* **Level 1** - You make Offense rolls at Boon +2.  
* **Level 0** - The default state, no effect.  
* **Level -1** - You make Offense rolls at Bane -2.  
* **Level -2** - You make Offense rolls at Bane -3.  
* **Level -3** - You make Offense rolls at Bane -4, and your Abilities that require Offense rolls cost 1 more HP or MP per Hero Tier.  

### The Defensive Track
* **Level 3** - Offense rolls made against you have Bane -4, and you gain [Shield](#shield-x) equal to twice your Hero Tier at the start of your Turn.  
* **Level 2** - Offense rolls made against you have Bane -3.  
* **Level 1** - Offense rolls made against you have Bane -2.  
* **Level 0** - The default state, no effect.  
* **Level -1** - Offense rolls against you have Boon +2.  
* **Level -2** - Offense rolls against you have Boon +3.  
* **Level -3** - Offense rolls against you have Boon +4, and you cannot gain Shield.  

#### Buff Track Duration  
Negative levels on the Buff Tracks have no duration, and must be removed via [Recover](#recover) or similar measures.  
Positive values begin decaying after 3 rounds. Receiving another increase along the corresponding Buff Track resets this timer. Once a buff track begins decaying, its level decreases at every [Round Start](#round-start).

> For example, Cyrick casts [Fortify](#fortify) on himself in Round 1 of combat. If he does not gain another boost in his Defense Track by Round 4, his Defense Buff would begin decaying. On Round 3, he uses [Hold Fast](#hold-fast), boosting his Defense Buff to level 2 and resetting the decay timer to Round 6. At Round 6's start, Cyrick's Defense Track decreases to 1. If he does not receive another defense buff by round 7's start, the track will decay to 0.  

## Positioning  
Knowing who you can reach and who can reach you is critical in combat, so these rules are here to help you keep up with the flow of a fight.  

### Zones  
Combat is broken up into Zones. A combat Zone should generally be somewhere between 15-20 feet in length on each side, whatever shape is appropriate for a given scene, and easy to understand on a quick drawing. It may represent a room or a hallway. A great hall in a large building may have several Zones. An open field would just be an effectively infinite number of Zones that characters can move through freely. Multiple creatures can occupy a single Zone, and everyone in a Zone can reach each other.  
Moving between Zones is done with Abilities. Everyone has access to the the most basic [Move](#move) Ability, and others such as [Run](#run) or [Mobile Strike](#mobile-strike) provide more advanced ways to position.  

### Advanced Positioning  
Rules for more advanced, granular, and tactical movement. These rules will not be used every combat; many combat scenarios don't really need this level of precision. The Arbiter should specifically point out when they're running a combat with these rules.  

#### Subzones  
Subzones are a way of dividing up a normal Zone in situations where precise positioning is necessary. Each Subzone is a portion of a larger Zone.  
When you first enter a Zone that contain Subzone, you choose which Subzone you land on. Any time after, you can change which Subzone you occupy by doing anything that would allow you to move.  
Unlike regular Zones, Subzones can only have one character in them at a time. Allies do not block movement for each other, but one cannot walk through Subzones that contain an enemy.  
You do not need to be in the same Subzone as an ally to affect them with your Melee Range Abilities (such as Guard or Healing Touch). Using these Abilities on an ally causes you to move adjacent to them automatically. You cannot do this if you do not have line of sight to target ally.  
Subzones generally come up when line of sight or cover becomes a factor in a fight. Each situation with Subzones includes rules on how line of sight or effect is determined in their descriptions.  
Characters can move between top level Zones as normal, regardless of which Subzone you start from.  
Some examples of Subzone use:  

##### Central column  
A Zone that includes a column, pillar, or other obstruction at its center. The containing Zone is divided up into 9 Subzones. The central Subzone is the column, which cannot be entered and blocks line of sight. To determine if you have line of sight, just count the number of Subzones away your target is. Count orthogonality; i.e. without moving diagonally. Any target more than two Subzones away is blocked; the pillar is between you and your target.

## Chasing rules
Sometimes when two opposing factions meet, one is not willing to stand and fight. This can result in a chase scene, in which one party is trying to get away from a pursuing party. The individual or group being chased is called the Quarry, while the one(s) doing the chasing are the Hunter(s).

### Position During Chases
During a chase, exact position doesn’t necessarily matter as much as distance between the Quarry and the Hunter. There is no need to make a large map to have a chase. Instead, assign each participant in the chase a number, representing how far they are from the chase’s starting point. This number is called the character’s Position, and it determines what they can do to other participants in the chase. At the start of the chase, the Hunter that’s farthest from the Quarry should be assigned Position 0, with others in the chase being assigned Positions based on how far from this starting point they are. Any action or effect that would normally cause you to move a Zone instead allows you to instead increase (or decrease) your Position by 1.

### Endurance
A chase is as much about endurance as it is about speed. You start every chase with an Endurance score equal to your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) + Toughness + Heart. You can spend Endurance to use one of the actions described below, or preserve it in order to continue a long-distance chase.  
At the [Round End](#round-end) during a chase, everyone involved that moved that Round must make an [Endure](#endure) check. This check starts at a target of 10, and on a success nothing happens other than the target increasing by 2 the next Round. On a failure, you lose one point of Endurance and the Endure check’s difficulty goes back to 10 for the next Round.  
If your Endurance score goes negative, you lose that much HP every time you move a Zone of your own volition during the chase.

### Actions During Chases
There are a few things one can do that is specific to chase scenes to consider.

#### Use Abilities
All Abilities available to you during combat are also available during chases. In order to use a Melee range Ability your Position must match your target’s. To use a Close range Ability, your Position must be within 1 of your target’s; for Medium, 3; for Long, 5; for Extreme, 8.  

#### Rush
Rushing during a chase is a Major Action, and allows you to move three Positions at once. Doing this costs a point of Endurance.

#### Rest
Rest is a Major Action, and you cannot use your Minor Action to do anything that causes you to move on the Turn you use it. This recovers one point of Endurance, up to a maximum of your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) + Toughness + Heart.

# Chapter 11: Health, Injury, Death, and Recovery
In the course of your group’s story, the players will face adversity. They will endure pain. Flesh fails, bones break, and blood flows. This is a part of adventuring, and all adventures make their own peace with this reality in time. This section of the rule book will describe the rules that govern this grim part of the hero’s journey.

## Damage Types
Broadly speaking, there are eight types of damage. Some beings may be vulnerable to some types while being resistant or immune to others. Ideally a party has a variety of damage types to work with with and can adjust to the enemy’s makeup as you go. Players are unlikely to know what types of damages work well upon first encountering a creature. They can use Scan Abilities to determine their targets’ elemental properties or try experimenting. Some things are reasonable to guess; an ice monster probably doesn’t like fire and doesn’t mind ice for example.

The damage types are as follows:
* *Physical* - Slashing, piercing, bashing. This is by far the most common type of damage.
* *Fire* - Burning, scorching, heat. Fire damage is broadly the way to describe damage that comes from using high temperatures.
* *Ice* - Piercing with icicles, chilling winds, sucking the heat out of the air. If the damage source is primarily low temperatures, it is ice damage.
* *Sky* - Zapping with lightning, being struck by slashing winds, and similar things. If it’s about electricity or wind, the damage type is Sky.
* *Earth* - Earth damage can be from launched rocks, being struck by plant vines, or a dip in acid. This is one of the more eclectic damage types, but it encompasses everything themed around the earth, from stones to the plants that grow from it.
* *Light* - Blinding radiance, searing lasers, holy light. Any time light itself is weaponized, it is light damage.
* *Dark* - Consuming blackness, draining life, unholy blight. If the damage comes from utilizing darkness or draining away the health of others, it is dark damage.
* *Almighty* - Beyond definition and comprehension, power in its rawest form. Almighty damage is extremely rare, and no force in existence can resist it.

With the exception of Almighty damage, enemies may have resistances or weaknesses to any combination of these damage types. A character can tell when they have struck a resistance or weakness as their blow lands; the results should be noticeably different from their expectations.  
If a damage type is not listed on an Ability, assume the damage to be physical.  

## HP
HP (hit points or health points, both work) are an abstract representation of a character’s health. While the character still has HP, they can press on. At a glance this could just be how much punishment the character can endure, but one could take it farther than that. Endurance, pain tolerance, mental fortitude, and dumb luck can all be part of a character’s HP.  

### Losing HP
Losing HP does not necessarily mean being struck by a weapon or attack. Remember, HP are abstract. Losing HP can be represented by narrowly avoiding a brutal attack (and thus using up one’s luck). It could be parrying a heavy blow, but suffering significant pain in one’s arm from the effort (testing one’s pain tolerance). It could be expending internal energy to throw an arcane shield up to deflect a spell (draining one’s endurance). And, maybe in the end, it could be getting a knife in the back. One should take getting hit as an opportunity for creativity, just like dealing a hit.  

### Reaching 0 HP
Upon reaching 0 remaining HP, a character is knocked unconscious and receives an Injury (explained below). They can take no actions and cannot be healed unless someone spends at least five minutes tending to them outside of combat or dangerous situations.  

## Injuries  
When you lose all HP, you take an injury and fall unconscious. You can’t move, take actions, and are completely unaware of your surroundings. Anything that would cause additional damage while you’re at zero HP causes an additional injury.  
Injuries in Story Shaper are the consequences of failing certain tasks or running out of HP. An injury reduces one of your [Attributes](#step-1-attributes) or [Vitality or Capacity](#vitalitycapacity) by one until it is tended to.  
When you sustain an injury in combat, roll a die and refer to this table for what type of injury.

##### Injury Type Table
| Die| Injury Type       |
|----|-------------------|
| 1  | Roll again twice  |
| 2  | Vitality          |
| 3  | Capacity          |
| 4  | Strength          |
| 5  | Finesse           |
| 6  | Toughness         |
| 7  | Mind              |
| 8  | Soul              |
| 9  | Heart             |
| 10 | None              |

1. *Roll again twice*. You've been struck so hard you take more than one injury with one blow.  
> In the unlikely event that a player rolls this more than once, the Arbiter should keep reasonable limits in mind. If the injury came from a minor brawl or from someone fighting without lethal intent, this result should not cause a character to suddenly explode with Injuries.  
2. *Vitality*. You've lost a lot of blood, taken an injury to your lungs or torso, or something similar that reduces your maximum health.  
> If this type of Injury (along with Strength or Toughness Injuries) causes a character's max HP to be 0 or less, the character should either die or fall into a coma, depending on the circumstances. In the case of a coma, it lasts until enough Injuries are healed to get the character back to positive max HP.  
3. *Capacity*. You've been concussed, suffered critical damage in your gear's energy storage systems, or something similar that limits how much energy you can bring to a fight.  
4. *Strength*. You’ve torn a muscle, broken a bone, lost so much blood that you can’t pack the same kind of punch as you used to, or something similar.  
5. *Finesse*. You’ve torn a ligament, broken your fingers, sustained nerve damage that makes movement difficult or painful, or otherwise lost mobility.  
6. *Toughness*. You’ve broken a rib and/or punctured a lung, lost a lot of blood, or otherwise picked up some affliction that makes you less vigorous than your best.  
7. *Mind*. You’ve suffered a concussion, have sight damage, are dealing with temporary memory loss, or some other problem that makes you duller than usual.  
8. *Soul*. You’ve suffered pain that breaks through your resolve, have a ringing in your ears, are generally questioning yourself, or something that interrupts your inner tranquility.  
9. *Heart*. You’ve suffered a concussion, severe pain, or perhaps perceive a betrayal (real or imagined) that makes you less sociable for the time being.  
10. *None*. You got lucky; while you still go unconscious, you suffer no lingering injury.  

As always, these methods of describing an injury are just suggestions. Players and Arbiters are free to come up with their own.

### Getting Injured
There are many dangers in an adventure that can result in an injury. The most obvious is hitting zero HP in combat, but this isn’t the only way. Here is a quick list of other ways to be injured. (Note that not all injury types are suitable in all circumstances. The Arbiter makes this choice and adjusts injury rolls appropriately. For example, if the dice roll a Heart injury from falling, the Arbiter may choose to reroll until something appropriate comes up.)
* Falling. Falling from a great height will typically result in injuries. For every 30 feet one falls, one will sustain an additional injury. Characters can make an Acrobatics check to try and reduce the damage from falling, reducing the height fallen by half the check’s result. Characters with [Flight](#flight) generally don’t need to worry about falling damage. Falling can cause Strength, Finesse, or Toughness injuries.
* Poison/Venom. The various creatures of the world may secrete harmful substances as they attack you. These will be listed in each creature’s information. A bite from a giant spider may cause a Finesse injury, while breathing in the spores of a territorial fungus might cause a Mind injury. These injuries can often be resisted with Endure checks.
* Traps. Slides into a spiked floor, arrows launched when a pressure plate is depressed, a bladed pendulum set to swing by a trip wire--these sorts of devious perils may cause HP damage, but they may instead leave lingering injuries, at the Arbiter's preference. They can typically be avoided with Awareness, Athletics, and/or Acrobatics checks. They can be disabled entirely with Sabotage checks.
* Fatigue. Circumstance forces a character to march throughout the night, forgoing food, water, and rest, through driving rain and cold and without shelter. This will wear on the character, and compounding fatigue is represented with injuries.
   * When going without sleep for a night, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take a random injury. On a success, you soldier on, but the next night you have to go without sleep you repeat the check with +5 difficulty. This continues stacking until you sleep for at least six hours. Failing this check does not reset the difficulty; only sleep can do that.
   * After two weeks without food, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take an injury to Strength, Endurance, or Dexterity. On a success, you can do without for a little longer. Every day spent without eating from here on requires another Endure check with +1 difficulty. This stacks until you get a good meal. Failing a check does not reset the difficulty.
   * After three days without water, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take a random injury. On a success, you can do without for a little longer. Every day spent without water from here on requires another Endure check with +4 difficulty. This stacks until you get a drink, and failure does not reset the difficulty.
   * Every day spent without shelter from severe rain, cold, or heat requires an Endure check, difficulty determined by the Arbiter based on the conditions. Failure results in an injury appropriate to the situation.

These are just a few examples, and the Arbiter can likely come up with more in their games.

### Recovering  
There are several ways to approach recovery of HP, MP, and injuries. Here are some recommended options. (Beyond healing Abilities, of course.)

* *Rapid, heroic pulp*.  The heroes bounce back from activity quickly, showing boundless energy. In this case, heroes regain all HP/MP after resting for 5 minutes. Recovering from an injury requires resting for an hour, which heals one injury of the player’s choice. 
   * This recovery method emphasizes action, enables risk taking, and encourages blowing everything quickly. This will result in faster battles since everyone is going full tilt at all times. Whatever happens will happen fast. 
* *Middle ground*. The heroes typically need a break after a dangerous encounter, and a long day of peril will wear them down. In this method, resting for an hour after a fight regenerates HP equal to the character's Toughness + [Max Potential](#max-potential) and MP equal to character's Heart + Max Potential (minimum 1 HP/MP). Resting for more than an hour provides no further benefit (unless that rest lasts 8 hours). Resting for 8 hours regenerates all HP and MP and heals one Injury. If the character is tended to by someone during this time, the tender may attempt a Medicine check, difficulty 15 + twice the number of injuries the target has received. On a success, the target heals one additional injury during their rest.  
   * This recovery system is a compromise, encouraging players not to blow everything immediately, but still potentially rewards explosive action and risk taking when appropriate.  
* *Survival*. Damage lingers. Injuries will pile up. MP are precious. In this format, resting for eight hours regenerates HP equal to your Toughness + Max Potential and MP equal to your Heart + Max Potential. Healing from an injury requires two full days of bed rest. If the character is tended to by someone during this time, the tender may attempt a Medicine check, difficulty 10 + the number of injuries the target has received. On a success, you heal an injury every day instead of every two days. 
   * In this format, you must track resources carefully and spend them dearly. Players are likely encouraged to avoid combat when possible and play extremely frugally when it does happen.

## Death
There is a point past which a character’s body can no longer endure injury, and they perish. For the enemies, this threshold should be quite low. Expendable sorts who play no major role in the story should likely just die immediately when their HP are spent. Plot-centric characters may have a higher threshold, three to five. The death of a player character has much larger implications on the game and should be considered more carefully. My recommendation is to declare a character with ten injuries dead.  

### Resurrection
Whether characters can come back from the dead is up to the Arbiter and should suit the setting. Allowing resurrection invites some serious questions. How common is it? What does it require? What stops antagonists from being resurrected after the heroes are done with them? The handbook is not going to set down hard rules for resurrecting dead player characters, because it should be custom to each setting. It could be a matter of a resurrection spell, regeneration through a clone, returning as some brand of undead, or the like.  
It’s worth noting that players are NOT necessarily entitled to this information. It’s up to the Arbiter.  

## Status Ailments  
Status Ailments are lingering problems that hamper a characters' ability to function in combat. Ailments always have a limited duration, and this duration can be reduced by effects such as [Cleanse](#cleanse) or [Healing Hands](#healing-hands). If multiple effects would cause the same Ailment, it instead increases the duration of the existing ailment.  

> I.E. If a character is already suffering from the Daze Ailment with a duration of 2 rounds is struck by an attack that inflicts Daze for another 2 rounds, they now have Daze for 4 rounds.  

### Afraid  
You are in the grip of a deep terror. This Ailment comes with an entity that you are Afraid of. At the start of your Turn, you *must* use your [Minor Action](#minor-action) to move away from whatever you're Afraid of. If you are unable to do so, you instead lose your Minor Action entirely. Offensive actions against you have Boon +2.  

### Blind  
You cannot see. If you attempt to strike a target that you can hear or whose location you know without need for sight, you only roll a single die for the attack. You cannot effectively defend yourself while blinded as well, so attacks against you gain Boon +6.  

### Chill X  
Partially frozen or dealing with a lingering cold. This reduces your Physical Defense by X for its duration.  

### Crush X  
Crushed by stones, blinded by sand, restrained by vines, or other similar means of hindering foes with the earth. This reduces your Physical Offense by X for its duration.  

### Daze  
Knocked off balance or punch-drunk. While you are Dazed you cannot take a [Counter Action](counter-action).  

### Degeneration  
You are afflicted with a condition that causes you to weaken over time. This could be bleeding, lingering burns, toxins, or the like. While affected by Degeneration, you lose HP equal to the remaining Degeneration duration on [Round Start](#round-start).

> For example, Cyrick currently suffers from 3 rounds of Degeneration. This causes him to lose 3 HP at Round Start. If nothing happens to change the duration of Degeneration on him, the next Round Start he will lose 2 HP. However, he sustains a hit that imposes 2 more rounds of Degeneration on his turn, leaving him with 4 rounds remaining. The next round, he loses 4 HP as a result.  

### Enervate  
Afflicted by a life draining curse, necromantic energies, disease, or similar hindrances. This reduces all life recovery you would receive by half for its duration.  

### Fatigue  
Tired in a way that interferes with your defenses. All damage multipliers against Fatigued characters are increased by 1.  

> This ailment can also be treated as a release valve for fights that are taking too long. If the Arbiter and players are getting tired of the fight, then it's likely the characters involved in the fight are starting to feel combat fatigue as well. If everyone agrees that it's time to wrap a fight up, all characters in the fight become Fatigued at the same time for the remainder of the fight. In this circumstance, treat Fatigue as a [Disadvantage](#disadvantages) instead of a Status Ailment (meaning it is not removed by Abilities like [Cleanse](#cleanse)).  
> I would recommend a minimum of 5 rounds before invoking Fatigue, and if everyone is still having fun in the fight longer than that then the characters can remain energetic enough to continue the fight as long as everyone wants.  

### Provoke  
An opponent has demanded your attention. Any actions you take that affect opponents must include the creature that Provoked you, including any area of effect.  
Provoke overrides [Taunt](#taunt); you ignore Taunt effects that would divert you from striking a foe who has Provoked you. In addition, you gain no benefit of being [Protected](#protection) from a target you have Provoked.  
This may represent an opponent shouting insults to grab attention, minor mind control, jamming targeting systems, or other similar ways to demand your aggression in combat.  

### Root  
For some reason, you cannot move. This might mean being tied down, having an injured foot, being entangled in grasping vines, or similar things that stop you from moving. Being rooted does not otherwise affect your combat ability, you just cannot move from your current space.  

### Scorch X  
On fire or dealing with a lingering burn. This reduces your Mental Defense by X for its duration.  

### Shock X  
Shocked, rattled by sonic damage, or the like. This reduces your Mental Offense by X for its duration.  

### Slow  
You are hobbled in a way that makes you slower, though you can still move somewhat. While slowed, you cannot use your Minor Action to move to a different Zone.  

## Disadvantages  
These are circumstances in combat that leave one in a disadvantage during combat. These generally cannot be dismissed through magical or technical means.  

### Flat Footed  
You are not prepared to defend yourself from attacks properly. Attacks against you are made at Boon +4. Unless otherwise noted, you cease being Flat Footed upon first taking an action or being successfully struck by a damaging Ability.  

### Marked  
Your position or defenses have been temporarily compromised. The next Offensive Ability that targets you does so at Boon +2 and ends the Marked state.  

### Prone  
Lying on the ground.  
Offensive Abilities used at Melee range against Prone targets have Boon +3, while any Offense rolls against Prone targets coming from beyond Short range are made at Bane -3. (Abilities used at Short range are made normally.)  
A Prone combatant making an Offense roll against a target in Melee range does so with Bane -3.  
Moving a Zone while Prone costs a Major Action. You may fall Prone or stand up as a Minor Action.  

### Stagger  
Knocked silly. While Staggered, you lose your Minor action and have Bane -1. Unless a different duration is listed, Staggers only last one Round (or 10 seconds outside of Initiative).  

## Advantages  
These are circumstances that give the character in question an advantage.  

### Charged  
You have prepared for a strong attack. When you have the Charged Advantage, you may choose to make your next Attack or Spell with Boon +6. Alternatively, you may increase the Damage Multiplier of the Attack or Spell by 1. Doing so removes the Charged property. Some Abilities require the Charged Advantage to function or add additional options to utilize your Charge.  

### Flight  
You can fly. This allows you to move into the airborne parts of the battle grid. Airborne movement is otherwise identical to standard movement.  
This Condition makes you immune to terrain effects.  

### Obscured  
You are invisible or otherwise very difficult to see, which makes you extremely difficult to hit or track. Any foe that is able to target you with a single target attack makes said attack with only a single die. (Obscured provides no benefit against area of effect attacks.)  

### Shield X  
You have a barrier or defense active that takes damage for you. While you have any amount of Shield, damage done to you subtracts from your Shield amount before your HP. You cannot use Shield to pay HP costs, and effects described as "losing" life or HP (such as HP loss from low Endurance during a chase) still subtract directly from your HP. Shield gained from different sources stack.  

### Taunt  
If you have Taunt and are in a space with any other ally, enemies must target you over other allies in the same Zone. Foes using Offensive Abilities that pick a single target can only pick you. Abilities that Abilities that affect Zones instead of targets can still affect your allies as normal.  
If multiple allies have Taunt in the same Zone, foes may choose between them at will. Abilities that affect multiple targets in a Zone (such as [Sweeping Strike](#sweeping-strike)) must prioritize targets with Taunt.  
[Protectors](#protection) are excluded from the redirection of Taunt and can be targeted as normal.  
A [Provoked](#provoke) combatant ignores Taunt, prioritizing instead whoever Provoked it.  
This might represent presenting yourself as an obvious target to draw fire, subtle mind control that redirects enemy attention onto yourself, or literally taunting people into fighting you first.  

## Linked States
Linked States are conditions that involve two different combatants. In Linked States, there is a primary creature causing the state, and a number of other creatures affected by the state (though usually just one).  

### Grab  
You are either keeping hold of a target (the Controller) or in another's clutches (the Captured). Neither the Controller nor the Captured can move.  
At the beginning of the Controller's Turn, they make an Offense roll against their target (Physical for Attacks, Mental for Spells as usual); if this roll fails the Captured escapes the Controller's grasp. Controllers may only Grab one creature at a time. Maintaining the Grab Linked State always has an Upkeep cost, specified in the Ability that starts the Grab. At [Round Start](#round-start), the Controller can end the Grab by simply not paying the Upkeep and releasing the Captured.  
Offense rolls against the Captured are made at Boon +2. When targeting anyone other than the Controller, the Captured also makes Offense rolls at Bane -2. The controller can also cover the Captured's mouth to silence them.  
A single target can be Grabbed by multiple targets. In this case, the Captured must escape each Controller separately.  

> As an example, Balam and Bannon have Grabbed a monster to try to keep it in place. None of the three can move in this state. On the monster's turn, it uses [Struggle](#struggle) to successfully shake of Bannon, but remains Grabbed by Balam and therefore unable to move.  

### Protection  
You are either providing an ally with Protection (the Protector), or are Protected by an ally.  
If you are the Protector, you cannot benefit from being Protected yourself. Standing in the same space as an ally with [Taunt](#taunt) grants you no benefit; enemies can freely choose between targeting you or the ally with Taunt.  
A Protected character cannot be targeted by offensive Abilities and is excluded from any offensive area of effect. You cannot be Protected from a foe you have [Provoked](#provoke).  
This can represent the Protector physically body blocking for the Protected ally, covering them with a shield, protection spells, and similar effects.
