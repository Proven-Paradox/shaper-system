## Chapter 0: Introduction
Assembled friends and enemies, welcome to the Story Shaper System. This is a tabletop role-playing game. (Don't worry too much about the "table" part of that; this system can be played online just as well.) This game is intended to facilitate improvisational storytelling. A group of however many players get together, each taking the role of a character in some fantastical story, while one person takes on the role of Arbiter, crafting the world and setting up a plot line. It's playing pretend, but with this book of rules deciding what happens during conflict and uncertainty. 

> Hi. I'm Dox, the designer of this system. We're in a box right now. When we're in a box, that means I'm talking to you as the designer, and the words in the box are not necessarily part of the rules. I'll do this as an occasional aside if I need to explain something in a context other than the rules. Just keep that in mind if you see another box like this later.  

## Core Tenets
These ideas are central to the design of Story Shaper. When designing the game these are the guiding concepts that I referred to for direction. Any time one designs a complex system of any sort, one will inevitably come to points where one must compromise something or cut some idea that had appeal at one point. These are the things I refused to negotiate or cut.  
* **Speed.**  If a given task is not going to be fun for most players at the table, Story Shaper will try to make that task quick, easy, and painless. If this has gone well, an experienced player who knows their character should never take more than two minutes to figure out the rules for his or her Turn. (Of course, one may take considerably longer describing these actions.)  
* **Versatility.** The rules have been written to allow players to describe their actions however they want. This system is intended to be usable in any fantastic setting. (With some restrictions on which Abilities are available, it could also be used for a modern setting.) The question of what a character can do is answered in the rules, but how they do it is left to be filled in by players.  
* **Depth**. Story Shaper has been constructed to create deep mechanics at every step of the game. Choosing your character’s Attributes, Abilities, and what they do in a given situation should present satisfying puzzles. One with many valid solutions that rewards smart play and mastery of the system, but NOT so many approaches to invite analysis paralysis or pitfalls that render characters impotent.

## What you Need to Play
### Required:
* A pair of 10 sided dice for each player (also called d10s).
* A single 6 sided die for the entire group
* Pencil and paper. 
> Do NOT use pen or something you can’t easily erase for anything. Trust me.

### Recommended but not vital:
* Standardized character sheets that help determine character attributes (provided in this book, have a copy for each player)
* A play mat with grid sections large enough to house multiple characters or a dry erase surface to help keep track of character positions
* A calculator
* A notebook for each player to write personal notes in

### Totally optional, but maybe fun:
* Miniatures to represent characters in combat
* A deck of playing cards or tarot cards (just in case a card game breaks out)
* Props to illustrate circumstances on the battlefield

> Here’s a cheap one: those plastic rings around bottled drinks can be removed and used as markers

# Chapter 1: How to Play
One of the most important things separating a roleplaying game from simple pretend is the addition of rules. In a game with no rules, it can be difficult to make something bad happen to another character. And a story where nothing bad happens to the heroes has no sense of adversity. Maybe that doesn’t bother you, in which case feel free to get with friends and have a great time just playing pretend with each other, societal norms be damned. But if you want to participate in a story where the stakes are high, danger is everywhere, and you don’t know what will happen to your character, you need rules and randomization to make things unpredictable.  

## Rolling Dice
In general when you are asked to roll dice in Story Shaper, you will roll a pair of ten sided dice. This gets you a range of 2 to 20, with results in the middle being significantly more likely than extreme results. You will then take the two dice, add the results together, and add a modifier to that which is based on your character’s attributes (more on that later). The higher the result, the better you did at the task in question.

### Rerolls
Some circumstances enable a player to reroll their dice. As a general rule, a given die can only be rerolled once, even if the new roll would otherwise qualify to be rerolled.

#### Boon
Circumstances or character traits sometimes grant a character an advantage that allows them to get favorable dice results in ways other than increasing their modifier. This is principally done by granting Boon +X. When a roll is made with Boon +X, the player may reroll one die if it is equal to or less than X. You must take the new roll, even if it is lower. Some examples of Boon in play:
* Varna makes a Stealth roll with Boon +3. He rolls his two d10s and gets a 2 and a 6. He chooses to reroll the 2, getting an 8, giving a final result of 6 + 8 = 14, plus his modifier.
* Jonny aims a gun and takes a shot that has Boon +2. He rolls his two d10s and gets a 1 and a 2. He can only reroll one die with Boon, so he chooses to reroll the 1 and gets a 4. His final result of 2 + 4 = 6, plus any modifiers.
* Marona is trying to haggle at a shop with Boon +4. She rolls a 4 and a 9. She is allowed to keep this roll if she likes, but chooses to use the reroll and gets a 1. Her final result is 9 + 1 = 10 plus her modifier.

##### Optional: Boon Splitting
Optionally, if a character's Boon magnitude matches or exceeds the sum of both dice, both may be rerolled. For example, if Rin makes a roll at Boon 4, and rolls a 3 and a 1, 3 + 1 = 4, meaning Rin can reroll both dice.

#### Bane
The unfavorable complement of Boon, Bane is sometimes imposed on a character when circumstances or sabotage make the character more likely to fail at a task. When a roll is made with Bane -X, the player must reroll their highest die if it is equal to or greater than (11 - X). Note that Bane does not go above -5, as rerolling any die below a 6 is statistically advantageous.

| Bane -X | Reroll a die above... |
|---------|-----------------------|
| -1      | 10                    |
| -2      | 9                     |
| -3      | 8                     |
| -4      | 7                     |
| -5      | 6                     |

Some examples of Bane in play:
* Adam is trying to follow tracks that have had some time to fade, imposing Bane -3, meaning he must reroll any results over 8 (11 - 3). He rolls a 9 and a 1. Bane forces him to reroll the 9, which comes up as a 2. Final result is 1 + 2 = 3.
* XU-808 has Bane -4 on an attempt to repair a damaged mechanism. He must reroll any result above a 7. He rolls a 7 and a 10. Because Bane specifies that one must reroll the higher die, the 10 is rerolled to a 3, for a final result of 7 + 3 = 10 plus any modifiers.

#### Combining Boon and Bane
If in a situation where Boon and Bane apply, they cancel each other out. Add their values and reroll based on the result. Some examples:
* Erin is attacking while affected by a blessing that gives her Boon +2, but is attacking an opponent who has a defensive spell that imposes Bane -1. Boon +2 and Bane -1 adds up to Boon +1, meaning she rerolls a die if she rolls a 1.
* Morris is attempting to pick a lock. His skill in lock picking gives him Boon +1 on the check, but his picks have been damaged in a way that provides Bane -3. Boon +1 and Bane -3 adds to Bane -2, meaning he must reroll a die if the roll is higher than 9.
* Arden is trying to leap over to a ledge. They have an item that grants them minor athletic ability with Boon +2, but a windstorm is making it harder with Bane -2. Boon +2 and Bane -2 adds to 0, so they will not have any opportunity or obligation to reroll dice.

### Let's get this over with: Some general rules  
Here are a few of the more fiddly rules that we need to get out of the way, just so there is no confusion.  

You count as your own ally. You can target yourself with anything that is listed to target allies.

Round down. If you ever have a fraction, just cut off the fractional bit entirely. Even if your result is (somehow?) 13.9, it should still be rounded down to a 13.  

In combat, defenders win ties. For example, if using an offensive Ability results in the accuracy role matching the defender’s Defense, the Ability misses and the defender suffers no consequence.  
For a tie during opposed skill checks (such as Empathy versus Deception, or Awareness versus Stealth), both characters reroll until there is no tie. Any Boon or Bane on the rolls still apply when rerolling due to a tie.  

If a damage type is not listed, assume the damage to be physical.

# Chapter 2: Character Creation
Before you can begin playing a game of Story Shaper, you have to know who (or what) the persona you’re taking control of actually is, what they can do, and what they struggle with. You should also flesh that character out, make them a person, someone who belongs in an interesting story. In this section, we will go through the steps of building characters.  
The focus will be on how the character is represented in rules. Fleshing out a character in the context of how that person fits into the world, what the character looks like, the characters motivations and fears, and similar details should be an exercise mostly taken between the Arbiter and the player.

## Step 1: Attributes
Each character’s general characteristics are represented by their “Attributes.” These are numbers that broadly represent the character’s capabilities. These add directly to at least two other secondary statistics and are added in when making certain skill checks (more on both of these subjects later).  
A zero represents average human performance in that Attribute, and from there it can go positive or negative. Two or above represents a gifted individual, and above five indicates superhuman ability. Negative two or below indicates an impairment that has a significant effect on one’s life, and negative five and below represents difficulty so severe that one cannot get by day to day without assistance.  
Your Arbiter will tell you the rules on how you determine your Attributes. My recommendation is to give between 5 and 7 points to spend, with the option to take a -1 in order to increase another attribute by 1. I recommend against randomizing Attribute generation, but I can’t stop an Arbiter who disagrees.

There are six attributes: Strength, Finesse, Toughness, Mind, Heart, and Soul. 
* **Strength** represents both raw strength and one’s ability to utilize strength. High strength may mean people ask your character to help move things for them a lot, or perhaps that they are on some kind of athletics team. They could be visibly muscular. Meanwhile, low strength might result in the character being spindly or out of shape.
   * Strength is also added to your Hit Points and Physical Offense stats.
* **Finesse** represents how agile or dexterous your character is. High finesse means that you would generally move with grace, or perhaps represents good aim or dexterity. Low finesse might instead confer general clumsiness.
   * Finesse is also added to your Initiative, Physical offense, and Physical Defense stats.
* **Toughness** represents health and hardiness. A character with high toughness may never seem to tire from physical activity or shrug off injuries with relative ease, while low toughness might mean the character is sickly or bruises easily.
   * Toughness is also added to your Hit Points and Physical Defense stats.
* **Mind** represents intelligence and cleverness. A character with high mind generally has a good memory, makes good grades if they put in the effort to do so, and is a great problem solver. Low mind often means difficulty learning new technical concepts and a hard time remembering details.
   * Mind is also added to your Mental Points and Mental offense stats.
* **Heart** represents charisma and presence. Someone with high heart is able to naturally be the center of attention or get people to do what they want, while someone with low heart might naturally go unnoticed in social situations or just generally lack presence.
   * Heart is also added to your Mental Points and Mental Defense stats.
* **Soul** represents centeredness and perception. Someone with high soul might not be religious but is likely very spiritual while also being good at reading people or noticing small details. Meanwhile someone with low soul would generally have a difficult time with spiritual pursuits such as meditation and also have a general obliviousness to them.
   * Soul is also added to your Initiative, Mental offense, Mental Defense stats.
   
If you’re struggling to come up with your Attribute arrangement, here are a few recommendations that can help.

* Be careful about overspecialization. Most characters want to be particularly good at doing one thing, but if you leave your character unable to do anything else at all you may end up unable to contribute in some situations. For example, a hero who has a very high HP pool along with high Defense attributes is good, but if said hero has no means of dealing damage or drawing a foe’s attention, the enemy may just ignore the character. A character with tremendous MP and Mental offense may do a lot of damage, but if said character’s HP and Physical Defense is low then they may not last long enough to utilize said MP. You can’t be good at everything, but try to be decent at a few things. If you do choose to completely specialize in one approach, you should consider choosing Abilities that will let you overcome your weaknesses.
* If you have stats to spare and you’re not sure where they should go, consider investing them in Toughness. More HP and Defense is always beneficial.

## Step 2-a: Point Stats
After choosing your Attributes, you can determine your point stats.
* **Max HP:** HP stands for hit points or health points (both work), and they are an abstract representation of a character’s health. While the character still has HP, they can still press on. At character creation you gain fifteen plus your Strength times three plus your Toughness times three HP. [15 + (STR x 3) + (TGH x 3)] (See [Chapter 12](#chapter-12-health-injury-death-and-recovery) for a more thorough description of what HP represent.)
* **Max MP:** MP stats for mental points or mana points. Hopefully you recognize a pattern here. While some Abilities spend HP, most require you to spend MP to use them. You start with fifteen plus your Mind times three plus your Heart times three. [15 + (MND x 3) + (HRT x 3)]
* **SP:** SP stands for skill points. This will be elaborated upon further when we discuss skills, but for now the higher this number is, the more things you’ll be able to do outside of combat. You start with 16 skill points.

## Step 2-b: Offense/Defense
These are modifiers to your attacks’ accuracy or your ability to avoid a foe's attacks. It is relatively rare for a roll to be modified only by one’s Attributes; rolls generally have two Attributes added as well as some modifiers from XP bonuses, as follows.

#### Physical Offense
This broadly represents your ability to effectively attack foes by mundane means. The better your Physical Offense, the more likely you are to successfully hit foes and do more damage with fists, melee weapons, and non-mental missile attacks. A high Physical Offense could imply great strength, well honed training, precise aim, and other such characteristics. You add your Strength and Finesse to Physical Offense.

#### Mental Offense
This broadly represents your ability to manipulate energy, technology, or other non-physical forces to strike out at foes. High Mental Offense could imply an intense well of inner power to draw upon, better understanding of technology used to inflict harm on others, a connection to some external power source you channel to lash out at your enemies, or something similar. The term “mental” is here mainly to differentiate it from “physical” and could easily be adjusted to apply to technology, magic, psychic powers, natural weapons, or other such power sources. You add your Mind and Soul to Mental Offense.

#### Physical Defense
This statistic represents your ability to mitigate mundane strikes sent against you. This could imply being quick enough to dodge attacks, tough enough to just ignore them, being equipped with armor or shields to protect you, or a combination of these effects. You start with 10 Physical Defense. You add your Toughness and Finesse to Physical Defense.

#### Mental Defense
Mental Defense enables you to mitigate damage you would otherwise take from energy attacks. High Mental Defense can imply being trained in counterspells or arcane shielding techniques, understanding and utilizing equipment or technology that dampens or redirects energy directed at you, or just being so resilient that you can endure the attack without harm. You start with 10 Mental Defense. You add your Heart and Soul to Mental Defense.

##### Defense Bonus
Some Abilities or effects sometimes use a value called "Defense Bonus." This can be Physical or Mental. This is just your total defense of the corresponding type without the base 10 everyone starts with. This value is mostly of concern to characters attempting to get some offensive value from their defensive stats. If the value in question is Physical Defense it will be listed as Physical Defense Bonus, while Mental Defense is listed as Mental Defense Bonus.

#### Initiative
At the beginning of a dangerous encounter (usually but not always combat) you make an initiative roll. This determines the order in which characters act. You add your Finesse and Soul to initiative rolls.

How one uses these attributes will be described in [Chapter 10](#chapter-10-combat).

## Step 3: Abilities
The next step is to choose Abilities. [Chapter 4](#chapter-4-abilities) goes into greater detail on what an Ability actually entails. In short, an Ability represents a maneuver that characters can utilize in combat. These will define your role when you’re fighting. When a character is created, they know 3 Abilities (two + one gained from being Level 1) for free as well as all Tier 0 Abilities.

Some advice if you want to make a powerful character and are having trouble choosing your Abilities:
* If you don’t have a better plan, you should have at least one Ability that fits within your character’s intended skill set. Your Strength dominant hero should have at least one melee attack. A Mind/Soul dominant hero is going to want mental attacks.
* That said, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If all of your attacks are melee range then an enemy who attacks from a distance will be a severe problem for you. If you have nothing but healing or support Abilities, then you will be helpless if you get separated from your allies. Once you have your core covered you might add some variety to your arsenal.
* At first your HP and MP pool will be limited. Keep costs in mind when picking Abilities. If an Ability requires too much of your MP to use often, maybe it’s not a good choice.
* It is wise to choose at least one Ability that requires a Minor Action to use. Doing so allows you to increase your effectiveness by letting you more consistently use both of your Actions. (More on Actions in [Chapter 10](#chapter-10-combat))

## Step 4: Skills
Next, you will distribute Skill Points. There’s more information on skills in [Chapter 6](#chapter-6-Skills), but the general idea is that skills are things that your character is generally good at aside from combat. Each skill has two Attributes added to their modifier, and you can use skill points to increase your base modifiers. Each skill can have skill points equal to your Level + 3 allocated. (So if you’re making a new character, you can spend at most 4 points per skill.) Skills will most often be utilized outside of combat, though certain enemies or Abilities may bring some to play during combat. You start with 16 skill points at character creation.

Here are some things to consider when distributing skill points:
* Skills are the portion of character creation most closely tied to roleplaying. Other aspects of the system have been intentionally divorced from having an impact on roleplay, but you should choose skills that make sense for your character to have.
* If you’re satisfied with your character’s representation but still have skill points remaining, consider coordinating with the other players. A given party would typically benefit from having all of their bases covered.
* If you’ve done the above and still have skill points, then consider increasing Athletics, Acrobatics, Awareness, Composure, Empathy, or Endure. These skills are either universally useful, reactive in nature, or may benefit the party to have multiple members able to use them well.

## Step 5: Talent
Finally, you choose one talent. Talents are described in full in Chapter 8; these are major changes that help define what your character is good at.

## Step 6: Elemental Properties
**Note that this step is optional.** Elemental properties are not appropriate for all settings or all characters. Consult your Arbiter on whether you should do this for your character when creating them.  
In settings where elemental magic is common, characters can start with a weakness to one element and a resistance to one other. The available elements are Fire, Ice, Sky, Earth, Light, and Dark.

> Note that there are no rules for items or equipment in this game. The Arbiter is free to make up magical or technological items where it suits. In general, basic equipment is not tracked in this game. Axes and swords don't have different stats. A character should start with their most essential items (weapons, armor, tools) assumed to be part of their kit. The basic idea is that characters in SSS are distinguished by what they can do, not what kind of gear they have. If you're playing a character with high strength, they can start with appropriate weapons. If your character is a mage, they can start with any implements they need to use their magic. If you're playing a very sturdy character, they could start with armor.

# Chapter 3: Improving your character
Rather than progressing in a class, heroes become stronger by spending experience points (XP). This will allow you to choose between a highly specialized character with a small number of very effective abilities, or a character that has many different tools, making them more likely to have exactly what is needed for a given situation.

## Gaining XP
This section will focus on how the party gains XP, and is mostly of concern to Arbiters.

The rate at which characters grow in power is, in the end, a matter of taste. There is never going to be an optimal way to schedule out how characters grow. As the Arbiter, that is up to you. There are no set rules on this.

> There are, however, recommendations I can give based on the results of my play testing. These are boxed because I'm going to be speaking in first person and from experience as an Arbiter rather than as a game designer.  
> In general, my recommendation is that a typical session that moves the plot forward gives the players 1 XP. This allows for slow, steady growth that you can reasonably keep on top of as an Arbiter. Sessions that involve a higher amount of risk or danger should give more XP, but not a ton more. I would say the completion of a story arc would merit 5 XP. Other sessions would fall somewhere between those two extremes.  
> Note that this does not only apply to overcoming physical danger. A tense negotiation might result in XP as much as a combat encounter.    
> If you go too slowly, players may come to feel stagnant or under-rewarded. Giving too much XP too quickly makes it more difficult to design suitable encounters for the players; if the player characters' strengths increase substantially session to session then you're at greater risk of substantially under or over estimating what makes for a good fight. Either of those results can be a disaster.   
> My play-testers all agreed that they'd prefer they all have the same XP. Other groups might disagree; it might be that players who don't show up don't gain XP, or perhaps the Arbiter might like to give bonus XP for thing like helping to run the game. Discuss this with the group before you begin playing.  
> I strongly recommend against giving role-playing XP. If the players don't want to role-play, that's fine; run a dungeon delving group. Role-play is supposed to be for its own sake (in my opinion).  

## Spending XP
Between sessions, you can allocate your XP to buy from the benefits listed in this section. Keep up with what XP was spent in what way on your character sheet.

If you're looking specifically for the XP cost of specific benefits, refer to this cheat sheet.

| Benefit                 | XP Cost                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Level up                | 4 + current Level         |
| Vitality/Capacity       | 3                         |
| Physical/Mental Attack  | 4                         |
| Physical/Mental Defense | 3                         |
| 3 Skill Points          | 1                         |
| Tier 1 Ability          | 3                         |
| Tier 2 Ability          | 5                         |
| Powers                  | 5 unless otherwise stated |
| Utilities               | Listed per entry          |

> An Arbiter might also give explicit moments in the middle of a session to spend XP when it suits the narrative. For example, if a character is put into a situation where they are actively training in a skill an Arbiter might give the character the opportunity to buy skill points or stat improvements related to that training.

### Level
While there are no set classes, heroes do gain levels. Their Level acts as a cap on certain values; multiple benefits that one can spend XP on can only go up to the hero’s Level. Increasing a character’s Level represents a general increase in competence and potential. A character’s Level limits the following:
* Every Level increases the number of times [Vitality and Capacity](#vitalitycapacity) can be purchased
* The hero’s base Physical Offense, Physical Defense, Mental Offense, and Mental Defense can be increased a number of times up to the character’s Level

In addition, purchasing a Level gives its own benefit that goes in a five Level loop. These benefits do not cost additional XP.
* At Levels 1, 6, 11, … the character gains an Ability of any tier they could normally learn. 
* At Levels 2, 7, 12, … the character gains one point in Vitality or Capacity.
* At Levels 3, 8, 13, … the character increases their Physical or Mental Defense.
* At Level 4, 9, 14, … the character increases their Physical or Mental Offense.
* At Level 5, 10, 15, … the character increases any one of their Attributes by 1 and gains a Talent (more on Talents in Chapter 8).

When Leveling up can have one of two benefits, the benefit must be applied to the lower option. For example, if a character which has one point in Vitality and no points in Capacity purchases Level 2, they gain a point in Capacity. If a character’s base Physical Offense (i.e. before Attributes and other modifiers are added) is 0 while their base Mental Offense is 3, and the character purchases Level 4, then their base Physical Offense improves by one. If there is a tie, the player chooses which improvement they gain.

Characters start at Level 1 (and therefore gain one free Ability in addition to the two they start with). Level 2 costs 5 XP, and each subsequent Level costs (4 + their current Level) XP. So Level 3 costs 6 XP, Level 4 costs 7 XP, and so on.

> Sidenote \<Milestone Levels>: Instead of allowing players to purchase Levels, the Arbiter may instead choose to declare that all characters Level up at certain milestones. While this does constrain players, it also ensures a given party will have fairly similar power ranges, making it easier to balance combat encounters while also making milestones feel more impactful.

#### Hero Tier
Hero Tier is a value that broadly represents your character's power. You start at Hero Tier 1, and every five Levels after the first (6, 11, 16, …) increases this value. Hero Tier is used to scale many facets of your character. 

> In general, increasing in Hero Tier represents a significant increase in competence and invites participation in more consequential events. 

### Vitality/Capacity
Purchasing Vitality increases your hero’s maximum HP by 5 + their Strength + their Toughness. Purchasing Capacity increases your hero’s maximum MP by 5 + their Mind + their Heart. Both of these can be purchased multiple times, up to your character’s [Level](#level). Vitality and Capacity upgrades cost 3 XP.

### Base Physical/Mental Offense/Defense
Every character has a base bonus to their Physical and Mental Offense and Defense. It starts at zero, but each category can be increased up to the hero’s [Level](#level). Increasing Physical or Mental Offense costs 4 XP, and increasing Physical or Mental Defense costs 3 XP.

### Skill Points
You may spend 1 XP to gain 3 skill points. The maximum number of points you can put into any skill is 3 + your [Level](#level).

### Abilities
Abilities represent things you can actively do, typically in combat. These can come from training in elaborate techniques, learning spells, building equipment, natural biology, or whatever justification is suitable for a given hero being able to do something.

Abilities come in two tiers. You may only purchase Abilities from tiers less than or equal to your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier). They cost 1 + (2 \* their tier) XP. So 3 for tier 1, 5 for tier 2.

Abilities are described in more detail in Chapter 4 and listed individually in Chapter 5.

### Lessons
Lessons represent passive abilities. These generally modify rolls, giving benefits when certain conditions are met. They offer notable benefits when using certain types of Abilities or grant a benefit in some conditions. Lessons cost 5 XP unless an exception is listed.

Lessons are described in more detail in Chapter 7.

### Talents
Talents represent significantly more impactful modifications to your character’s abilities. They either apply more broadly or have much higher influence than Lessons, and as such they are only available at first [Level](#level), and then when you reach a Level divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15…). They have no cost to purchase.

Talents are described in more detail in Chapter 8.

### Utilities
Utilities represent non-combat abilities that aid an adventurer. These may influence Skill rolls, or grant new options for a given hero. There is no limit on the number of Utilities a given character may purchase, and the XP cost for each Utility is listed in its entry.

Utilities are described in more detail in Chapter 9.

# Chapter 4: Abilities
Abilities represent powers or moves your character is able to do, usually in combat. When you first create a characterstart with three Abilities. Additional abilities are purchased for XP. Abilities come in two tiers (currently), with each tier being more powerful (but more costly) than the previous. You must reach [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) 2 to purchase Tier 2 Abilities.

## Reading Abilities
Ability entries will follow this basic layout (and further information about each aspect will be expanded upon after the summary):

**The Name of the Ability**  
Ability Type (Attack/Spell/Auxiliary)  
Action (Major/Minor/Counter): whether the Ability requires a Minor, Major, or Counter Action to use.  
Prerequisites: What other things are required before one can learn this Ability.  
Range: How far away a target can be while still being in reach of this Ability. There are five possible ranges:  
* None - this skill targets yourself.
* Melee - this skill can only be used on targets in the same Square as you.
* Short - this skill can be used on targets up to one Square away.
* Medium - this skill targets enemies up to two Squares away.
* Long - this skill targets enemies up to three Squares away.  

Targets: Who or what this Ability targets.  
Cost: The HP or MP cost of this Ability.  
Damage: When using this Ability to do damage, multiply your [Impact](#impact) by this number to determine the amount.  
Effect: Things particular to a given Ability.  
Description: A general overview of what a given Ability might represent from a roleplaying perspective.  

## Prerequisites
Sometimes an Ability has a prerequisite listed in its entry. This means that you must fulfill the listed conditions before you are allowed to take that Ability. Generally this will be another Ability, often representing related skills building off of each other. There are other things that could be prerequisites, such as Skills, as well. If at any time you no longer fulfill the prerequisites for a given Ability, you can no longer use it.

## Ability Types
There are three types of Abilities.
* **Attack** means that the Ability uses Physical Accuracy and is resisted by Physical Defense.
* **Spell** means that the Ability uses Mental Accuracy and is resisted by Mental Defense. 
   * Note that just because the term used here is “spell” the Ability does not have to represent magical actions. The effect could be produced by technology, alchemy, bizzare anatomy, or some other thing.
* **Auxiliary** Abilities do not use offense rolls. They generally target yourself or your allies.
   
## Ability Series
Some Abilities are part of a series, building off each other and using each other as prerequisites. A quick explanation of each follows:
* **Augment** - Auxiliary abilities that empower allies.
* **Curse** - Auxiliary abilities that weaken foes.
* **Elemental** - Abilities which deal damage through one of the elements:
   * *Fire* - heat and flames
   * *Ice* - sharp icicles and freezing cold
   * *Earth* - shards of rock, acid, and plant vines
   * *Sky* - electricity, wind blades, and the like
   * *Light* - radiance, blinding light, and holy power
   * *Dark* - Destroying life essence, sharpened shadows, or unholy power
* **Healing** - Abilities that focus on restoring and rejuvenating allies. This can be by magically mending wounds, quickly bandaging cuts, singing a song that restores their spirits, or recharging their shields.

## Ability Keywords
Some specific terms come with Abilities. These can be effects that Abilities confer on you, or things that change how you use the Abilities themselves. Here are their definitions:

### Careful
An Ability that normally only uses the listed Major or Minor Action, but that is improved if you also use your second Action on it, representing taking the time to do it right.

### Cooldown
An Ability that, once used, cannot be used again for some duration, listed in the Ability. Cooldowns decrease by 1 at [Round Start](#round-start).

### Overload
An Ability that can be improved if you add an additional cost. This represents putting more of your energy or power into the Ability.

### Upkeep
Any Ability with an Upkeep in its cost requires the given cost to be paid at [Round Start](#round-start). As long as the Upkeep is paid, the Ability has no duration. (To clarify; the listed cost is paid when the action starting it is taken, and the Upkeep cost is paid on all subsequent rounds.)

## Buff Tracks
These are a way of measuring advantage or disadvantage Offense or Defense. Unless you are in conditions that specify otherwise, you start every combat at level 0 in both tracks. Several different Abilities can affect this track, which provides appropriate benefits or downsides to every character in a unified way.

#### The Offensive Track
* **Level 3** - You make Offense rolls at Boon +4, and your Mental and Physical Offense increase by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).
* **Level 2** - You make Offense rolls at Boon +3, and your Abilities that require Offense rolls cost 1 less HP or MP per Hero Tier. This cannot take an Ability’s cost below 1.
* **Level 1** - You make Offense rolls at Boon +2.
* **Level 0** - Normal, no changes.
* **Level -1** - You make Offense rolls at Bane -2.
* **Level -2** - You make Offense rolls at Bane -3, and your Abilities that require Offense rolls cost 1 more HP or MP per Hero Tier. 
* **Level -3** - You make Offense rolls at Bane -4, and your Mental and Physical Offense decreases by your Hero Tier.

#### The Defensive Track
* **Level 3** - Offense rolls made against you have Bane -4, and your Mental and Physical Defense increases by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).
* **Level 2** - Offense rolls made against you have Bane -3, and you gain [Shield](#shield-x) equal to twice your Hero Tier at the start of your Turn.
* **Level 1** - Offense rolls made against you have Bane -2.
* **Level 0** - Normal, no changes.
* **Level -1** - Offense rolls against you have Boon +2.
* **Level -2** - Offense rolls against you have Boon +3, and any Shield you gain is halved.
* **Level -3** - Offense rolls against you have Boon +4, and your Mental and Physical Defense decreases by your Hero Tier.

#### The Regen/Degen Track
Unlike the previous tracks described, the regen/degen track has no limit aside from what is mentioned in the Ability description. At [Round End](#round-end) you gain or lose HP equal to your value on the track, and then move one point closer to 0. Positive values can represent gradual magical healing, an injection of tissue repairing nanobots, or similar ways to heal over time. Negative values could represent venom, bleeding, being drained of energy, or similar sources of gradual damage.  
> For example, if Roland is at 3 on the track, he regains 3 HP and his position then becomes 2. Unless something further happens to change his position, the next Round he would recover 2 HP and move to 1 on the track.

# Chapter 6: Skills
Skills represent what your character is good at more broadly than Abilities. Skills are general purpose things and are usually rolled outside of combat, though they may come up in combat at times.  

Your maximum number of Skill Points that can be invested into any one Skill is equal to your [Level](#level) + 3.  
Each skill has two associated Attributes. All skills of that type add those two Attributes in addition to any skill points that have been spent in those skills.  
Skill checks should only occur when there is some sort of pressure or danger present in a situation, or if the action being attempted is of non-trivial difficulty. For example, the Arbiter generally should not call for a Skill check to climb a ladder unless the character doing it is rushed, being attacked, or under similar duress. If that same character were trying to climb a sheer cliff face, an Athletics check is necessary.  
Skills can also be used to answer questions about a related subject. For example, if you needed to know how much weight a pillar can bear, you can make a Construct check. To identify a song being played by someone else, roll a Performance check. To know the correct greeting in a formal situation in an unfamiliar land, make a Diplomacy check. To estimate the value of a pocket watch or a cut jewel you’ve found, make a Craft check.   

## Helping Others
In situations where others need help with a skill you are well trained in, you can make the roll in their place. When you do this, you roll with half of your modifier. The character you are helping then treats that result as their own. Note that it is not always possible to help others with their checks.

## Skill List

#### Acrobatics  
Attributes: Strength, Finesse  
Balancing, tumbling, contorting. Tasks that require precise movements as well as power.

Lying, disguise, conning. This skill is called for any time you wish to mask the truth.  
Alternatively, this skill can be used as a player aid. If a player happens to be less skilled at deception than the character they are playing would be, the Arbiter may allow the player to roll a Deception check to get a suggestion for what to say in a given situation.

#### Diplomacy  
Attributes: Heart, Soul  
Negotiation, decorum, sociability. This skill is used when a player wants to make a good impression in a social situation.  
Alternatively, this skill can be used as a player aid. If a player happens to be less silver tongued than the character they are playing would be, the Arbiter may allow the player to roll a diplomacy check to get a suggestion for what to say in a given situation.

#### Drive  
Attributes: Finesse, Mind  
Handling vehicles or mounts. Options include a mount, a car, a ship, a plane, or anything similar. 

#### Empathy  
Attributes: Heart, Soul

#### Endure  
Attributes: Toughness, Heart  
Pain tolerance, doing without, pressing on. This is a reactive skill: if a player is subject to forces that would impair their functioning, they can shrug it off with a successful Endure check.

#### Intimidation  
Attributes: Strength, Heart  
Browbeating and bullying. When the player wants something and is willing to threaten others to get it, this is the skill to use.

#### Investigation  
Attributes: Mind, Soul

#### Lore  
Attributes: Mind, Soul  
Forbidden secrets, occult rituals, and mysticism. This skill represents one’s exposure to obscure, often taboo knowledge.

#### Medicine  
Attributes: Mind, Finesse

Attributes: Finesse, Heart  
Singing, dancing, storytelling. This skill is used to gauge how entertained a crowd is with a show.

# Chapter 7: Lessons
Broadly speaking, Lessons represent passive combat benefits or extra options available to someone trained in specific style of combat. Some Lessons will list prerequisites; if that is the case then you must meet these prerequisites to be able to take the Lesson, and if you ever fail to meet those prerequisites you gain no benefit from the associated Lesson.  
Lessons cost 5 XP unless an exception is listed.

#### A Curse Most Foul  
When using a Curse Ability, you may choose one or both of the following benefits.
* If the Curse costs HP, you may spend MP instead. If it costs MP, you may spend HP instead.
* If the curse decreases a victim on the [Buff Track](#buff-tracks), the victim of your Curse also takes damage equal to your [Base Offense](#base-physicalmental-offensedefense). Use Base Physical Offense if the Ability is an Attack, or Base Mental Offense if the Ability is a Spell.

#### Advantageous Recovery  
When you strike a foe’s elemental weakness, you regain HP or MP equal to your Mind, up to a maximum equal to the HP or MP used to perform the striking Ability. This benefit increases as you raise your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier): the recovery increases by an amount equal to your Mind (so Mind x 2 at Hero Tier 2, Mind x 3 at Hero Tier 3, and so on). This Lesson can only be activated once per Ability use; striking multiple foes with one Ability cannot restore HP or MP more than once.

#### Aggressive Provocation  
When you target an opponent you have [Provoked](#provoked) with an Attack or Spell, you may use your Physical [Defense Bonus](#defense-bonus) in place of your Physical Offense, or Mental Defense Bonus in place of your Mental Offense.

#### Anger  
Whenever you receive damage you may enter an Enraged state. Spending HP to use an Ability or any effect described as “lose life” (such as losing HP due to low Endurance during a chase) does not count as damage. Damage from any source can activate Anger. While Enraged, your Physical and Mental Offense increases by 2, but your Physical and Mental Defense decreases by 3. Every time you increase in [Hero Tier](#hero-tier), the Offense bonus and Defense penalty both increase by 1. If you end your Turn without having received damage since the end of your previous Turn, you are no longer Enraged.

#### Ataraxia  
If you have not moved between the beginning of your previous Turn and your current Turn, you may reduce the MP cost of any Spells you cast by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) (to a minimum of 0).

#### Bloodlust  
When you successfully kill or knock out a foe, your next Attack is made at Boon +6.

#### Curse Resistant  
The first time you would have one of your [Buff Track](#buff-tracks) reduced each battle, ignore the effect. For the purposes of this Lesson, a period of 30 minutes or longer without being in mortal peril is considered a separate combat.

#### Dash  
When you move as a Major action, you can choose to move two Squares instead of one.

#### Double Ward  
When you use [Ward](#ward), you may choose to increase the cost to 3 MP. If you do, you may choose a second element. The applied ward protects against both kind of damage. The ward is still expended after protecting against a single Ability. This counts as paying an Overload cost.

#### Enduring Protector  
After taking damage in place of an ally--for example, when using an Ability such as Defender’s Intervention--or are targeted by a single target offensive Ability while you have [Taunt](#taunt) and are in the same space as another ally, you gain [Shield](#shield-x) equal to your Toughness. This benefit increases as you raise your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier): the Shield increases by an amount equal to your Toughness each Hero Tier (so Toughness x 2 at Hero Tier 2, Toughness x 3 at Hero Tier 3, and so on). This Shield lasts until the beginning of your next Turn. You may only gain this Shield once per round.  

#### Elemental Attunement  
When you gain this Lesson, pick one of the following: Fire, Cold, Sky, Earth, Light, or Dark. Whenever you use an Ability with the [Elemental] tag, you may chose to deal damage of the corresponding type.  
Special: You may take this Lesson more than once, choosing a different element each time. The first time you gain an Ability with the [Elemental] tag, you also automatically gain Elemental Attunement for free once.  
Every instance of this Lesson costs 3 XP.

#### First to Act  
Increase your Initiative modifier by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier). Also, you gain Boon +2 on Initiative rolls.

#### Fortifying Voice  
When you target creatures with an Augment, all affected gain [Shield](#shield-x) equal to your Mental [Defense Bonus](#defense-bonus).

#### Healing Rush  
After you successfully heal an ally, choose one of the following effects. These effects last until the beginning of your next Turn.
* Increase the target’s Physical or Mental Offense by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).
* Increase the target’s Physical and Mental Defense by your Hero Tier.
* The target can move an extra Square when making default movements. (This does not affect Abilities that involve movement.)

#### Hit and Run  
Once per Turn, when you use a melee range Attack, you can move one Square as part of the Attack. You can do this before or after making the Attack.

#### Improved Healing  
When casting a Healing Ability, you may roll an additional ten-sided die. Remove the lowest die from your total result.

#### Layering Ward
You can give allies additional layers of protection using [Ward](#ward) or other Abilities that produce Wards. You may target an ally already affected by your Ward, allowing that Ward to affect an additional incoming Ability before fading. Your Wards have a maximum of 3 attacks.

For example, Drahlo has placed a Fire Ward on himself using the [Ward](#ward) Ability. During his Turn, he uses Ward again, empowering his existing Ward to reduce damage from 2 Fire elemental Abilities.

#### Lingering Provocation  
Any time you [Provoke](#provoked) a target, that Provocation lasts for 2 rounds.

#### Long Arm of Justice  
Increase the range at which you Counter Abilities can affect enemies by 1. For example, the Riposte Ability normally only reaches enemies in melee range. With this Lesson, Riposte would also function against enemies who strike from Short range. (This could be reflecting missiles, expanding your retaliation field, invoking stronger magical counters, or something similar.)

#### Manamaim
Whenever you pay an Overload cost on a damaging Spell, you may add your [Capacity](#vitalitycapacity) to your damage. This extra damage is not included in multipliers.

Example: Merlin has the Manamaim Lesson, Capacity 4, and casts Elemental Lance with the Overload cost. His opponent has Mental Defense 12, and his Offense total is 17. The [Impact](#impact) is 5, and with the Overload cost paid Elemental Lance has a x2 multiplier. This results in 10 damage, plus 4 from Manamaim, resulting in 14 damage.

#### Manamend
Whenever you pay an Overload cost on an Ability that heals HP damage, add your [Capacity](#vitalitycapacity) to the total healing done.

#### Masochism  
Any time you spend HP to use an Attack or Spell, you gain [Shield](#shield-x) equal to the spent health that lasts until your next Turn. If you successfully hit with an Ability that costs HP, you deal that HP cost as extra damage (after the Multiplier is applied).

#### Overcharge  
If your healing would bring your target above maximum HP, the target gains [Shield](#shield-x) to the excess. Targets can only have one Shield from this Lesson; if a larger Shield would be applied by this Lesson, the smaller one fades immediately. The Shield also fades at the start of your next Turn.

#### Pickup  
When you heal an ally from 0 HP, add twice your Heart to the healing done. This benefit increases as you raise your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier): the additional healing increases by an amount equal to your twice your Heart each Hero Tier (so Heart x 4 at Hero Tier 2, Heart x 6 at Hero Tier 3, and so on).


#### Quick Healer  
Once per round, increase any HP restoration you receive by half.  
> Remember that all fractions round down. If you haven't used your healing by [Round End](#round-end) you may improve the healing from [the Regen/Degen Track](#the-regendegen-track) or the [Everlasting](#everlasting) Talent.

#### Relentless  
When you successfully strike with an Ability that forces a target to move, you gain the following benefits.  
* You may automatically move toward the target as many spaces as you forced them to move. If you forced multiple targets to move, choose one to follow.
* Your target is [Rooted](#rooted) until your next Turn.

#### Resilient Protector  
When you take a would blow in place of an ally--such when using an Ability such as Defender’s Intervention--or are targeted by a single target offensive Ability while you have [Taunt](#taunt) and are in the same space as another ally, increase your Physical and Mental Defense by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) for that Ability.

#### Sadism  
When you kill or knock out a foe, increase your [Offensive Track](#the-offensive-track) by 1.

#### Sanctuary Ward  
When you place a [Ward](#ward) on an ally that corresponds to their Elemental weakness(es), they become no longer weak to that Element.

#### Siege Fighter  
If you have not moved between the beginning of your previous Turn and your current Turn, your Physical and Mental Offense increases by an amount equal to your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).

#### Spell Sniper  
If you have not moved between the beginning of your previous Turn and your current Turn, the range of any spell you cast increases by one Square.

#### Spell Strike  
If you successfully strike with an Attack Ability with your Major Action, you may use a Tier 1 Spell Ability that normally requires a Major Action as a Minor Action.  
If you successfully strike with a Spell Ability with your Major Action, you may use a Tier 1 Attack Ability that normally requires a Major Action as a Minor Action.

#### Superior Scanner  
When you use a Scan Ability, choose one of the following benefits.
* You automatically scan Squares instead of individuals, simultaneously learning about all creatures in that Square as well as checking for invisible creatures and objects in that Square.
* You learn the target’s Physical and Mental Attack in addition to the usual stats.
* You gain Boon +4 on the Stealth or Deception roll to conceal your use of the Scan Ability from your target.

#### Wardsense  
You are able to sense and identify wards placed by enemies accurately.  
Special: This Lesson costs 3 XP.

#### Wide Ward  
When you use a single target Ward that normally has a Minor action requirement, you may increase that to a Major action. If you do, the Ward affects one Square. Applying this Technique counts as using a Careful action, even on Abilities that normally do not have the [Careful] tag.

------------

A character gains a Talent for free at [Level](#level) 1, and again when gaining a Level divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15, ...).

#### Arcane Evasion  
Your agility aids you in evading magical effects. You may use your Finesse in place of Heart to determine your Mental Defense.

#### Elemental Specialist (TYPE)
Choose one element: Fire, Cold, Sky, Earth, Light, or Dark. You gain the following benefits:  
* You gain [Elemental Attunement](#elemental-attunement) for the associated element.  
  * If you already have Elemental Attunement for the chosen element, you may either gain Elemental Attunement with a new element, or regain the 3 XP invested in gaining Elemental Attunement originally.
* You gain resistance to the chosen element.
  * If the chosen element was previously your weakness, you must choose a new element to be your weakness.
* If you spend an additional 1 MP per tier of the Ability you are using, you may convert physical damage you do into the chosen element.  
  * Tier 0 Abilities require no additional cost to convert.
  * Your converted damage still targets the usual Physical or Mental Defense.
* You gain an additional benefit unique to each element as follows
  * Fire - Successfully dealing Fire damage also decrease the target's [Regen/Degen Track](#the-regendegen-track) by 2 every time you successfully hit with a Fire skill. This can build up to a maximum of 2 + your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).
  * Cold - Successfully dealing Cold damage also [slows](#slowed) the target for 2 rounds. If you successfully deal Cold damage to a target that is already slowed, they instead become [rooted](#rooted) for 1 round.
  * Sky - You may move before or after using an Ability that deals Sky damage. You must end your movement such that you still are within the triggering Ability's range to the target.
  * Earth - Successfully dealing Earth damage allows you to move the target one Square. You cannot use this benefit if you have moved this Turn, and after using it you cannot willingly move afterward until your next Turn.
  * Light - Successfully dealing Light damage allows you give [shield](#shield-x) to an ally within the triggering Ability's range. The magnitude of this shield is equal to half the damage done.  
  * Dark - Successfully dealing Dark damage heals you for half the damage done.
* Your damage multiplier for all Abilities that deal your specialized damage type increases by 1 when you reach [Level](#level) 10.  
Note that to gain these benefits, the damage must be done by you personally. If using the Summoning module, your summoned allies do not benefit from this Talent.

#### Endurance Mage  
You can draw energy from your body to fuel your abilities. You may use your Toughness in place of your Mind to determine your MP.

#### Everlasting  
At the [Round End](#round-end) of every Turn, you regain HP equal to your [Vitality](#vitalitycapacity). When you gain this Talent, you also gain one level of Vitality without paying the XP cost.

If you ever reach zero HP, you cease regaining HP until you are given healing from another source.  

#### Finesse Caster  
You have the skill to place a spell just right--your potency is less about the power behind the spell and more about the correct application. You may use your Finesse in place of Soul to determine your Mental Offense.

#### Flight  
Your maneuverability allows you to overcome gravity, be it through magical power, transmuting wings for yourself, equipping and successfully piloting a jet-pack, or similar means of propulsion. You gain the Flight property.  
This Talent makes the [Hover](#hover) and [Slow Fall](#slow-fall) Utilities redundant. If you previously took the Hover Utility, you lose it but regain the 2 XP spent. Likewise, if you previously took the Slow Fall Utility, you lose it but regain the 4 XP spent.

You're just lucky sometimes. You may reroll a number of d10s equal to 2 + your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier). Your rerolls refresh after you spend six hours not using any. You still cannot reroll dice that have already been rerolled, either through this Talent or through Boon/Bane.

#### Mana Fountain

Your heart powers your body more than your muscles. You may use Heart in place of Strength when determining your HP.

#### Soul Well  
You can tap the power of your spirit to sustain your spells. You may use your Soul in place of Toughness to determine your HP.

# Chapter 9: Utilities
Broadly, Utilities are things your character can do that are not related to combat. There is no limit to the number of Utilities a character can have.  
 
## Skill-based Utilities
Unless otherwise stated, all Skill-based Utilities cost 3 XP.

#### Asceticism  
Increase your Endure modifier by 1.  
In addition, you can go 2 weeks without food or water with no ill effect, no need to make Endure checks. When you sleep, you enter a state of meditation and are still aware of the world around yourself. This enables you to awaken with full lucidity instantly and to make Awareness checks while sleeping without penalty.

#### Darksight
Increase your Awareness modifier by 1.
In addition, you are unaffected by low or no light conditions. This could represent extremely acute hearing, access to infrared goggles, being able to cast a spell that lets one see in darkness, or other means of bypassing darkness. This does not significantly impact your ability to be seen in darkness like carrying a flashlight would.

#### Eidetic Memory
Increase your Lore modifier by 1.
You are able to reliably remember information correctly. You may ask the Arbiter for clarification on things the character remembers but the player may not, and the Arbiter will give an accurate answer. This includes things like dates, times, names, articles in magazines, newspapers, or online.

> Player, ask the Arbiter before taking this Utility; this puts a lot more pressure on the Arbiter to remember everything. Both the Arbiter and the player should be open to improvising and hand-waving if the Arbiter misremembers, and the player should do their best to help this Utility along by taking notes of things they may remember.

#### Extraordinary Saboteur  
Increase your Sabotage modifier by 1.  
You can also gain one of the following benefits at a time.  
* If you set up a trap, increase the necessary Investigation check requirement by your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier).
* When destroying a device, you can set up the failure to occur after a delay. Upon successfully using Sabotage to damage the device, you can set a delay of up to ten minutes. Once used, the affected device functions normally for the specified amount of time before the malfunction you caused comes into effect.
* If dealing with a trap laid by someone else, you can temporarily bypass the thing instead of destroying it, allowing your party to pass without leaving evidence of your tampering.

#### Natural Intuition  
Increase your Empathy modifier by 1.  
When you successfully detect that someone is lying to you with an Empathy check, you automatically gain a small insight into their motivations. This comes as a single word. Some examples:
* The target is being blackmailed by someone who can ruin their lives, forced to work against the party. “Fear”
* The target is a petty conman and just wants to score some easy coin off the party. “Greed”
* The party includes an elf, the target is an orc, and there is still long standing, mutual dislike between elves and orcs since a war between them two decades ago. “History”
* The target is secretly after revenge against someone in the party. “Enmity”

#### Well Connected  
Increase your Diplomacy modifier by 1.  
In addition, you can assume you have connections in any non-trivial settlement you travel to. This can be the result of celebrity status, being a member of a well known and respected organization, or just having a lot of friends (or friends of friends) around the realm. This person should be generally friendly and/or sympathetic to your cause (within reason) and familiar with the customs of the region. Beyond that, your connections’ details are up to the Arbiter. Discuss the ramifications of this Connection with the Arbiter before taking it so they can prepare appropriately. When coming to a new location, you can ask the Arbiter who your connection is and what you know about them.

#### Whispered Wisdom  
Increase your Lore modifier by 1.  
You can also glean information about locations or events intuitively. This can be consulting with spirits of the area, unlocking the memories of objects in the vicinity, getting brief glimpses of the past or future, consulting an advanced AI, and other ways one might gather small bits of information. You may conduct a ritual seeking the answer to a single question that takes at least one minute and make a Lore check, the difficulty of which is determined secretly by the Arbiter. If you succeed, you can get a clear yes/no answer or a short, often cryptic phrase to guide you. If you fail, there will be no answer.  
To determine the difficulty of the Lore check, the Arbiter should consider several factors. How obscure is the topic being asked about? If it’s about a location, was it the location of significant events? Are there forces at work trying to keep the information hidden? If it’s about a person, how powerful are they? (Powerful individuals tend be more difficult to learn about through this feature.)

## Other Utilities 

#### Hover  
XP Cost: 2  
You can fly up to five feet off the ground.  
This could represent wings that don’t quite have the strength to fully fly, a personal anti-gravity field, a spell that produces a hovering platform, or something similar.  
While not as versatile as fully functioning flight, this allows to you avoid hazards on the floor, reaching a ledge that is otherwise too tall to get to, and any other advantage one could imagine comes with being slightly airborne.  
This does not protect you from falling damage; if you are suddenly more than five above the ground you will fall as normal.
This Lesson makes you immune to natural terrain effects.

#### Lip reading  
XP Cost: 3  
You can read lips, i.e. if you are close enough to see a creature's face while it speaks, you know what they are saying. 

#### One with Nature: Animals  
XP Cost: 3  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with animals. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you gain a basic understanding of animal speech.  
Animals have simple, instinctual desires and are usually very focused on the here and now. Most quickly dismiss past events that don’t affect their ability to survive and don’t really understand “the future” as a concept.

#### One with Nature: Minerals  
XP Cost: 3  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with minerals. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you have learned to tap into a subtle consciousness that is present in stone, metal, and gems.  
Minerals have long memories, but no ability to move and thus a very limited frame of reference. They also have a difficult time telling moving things apart; seeking information about a specific person while speaking to stone is unlikely to be fruitful unless no one else has passed by in a very long time.  
You may only use this method of communication to speak with unworked minerals. The process of cutting gems for jewelry or forging metal for equipment “kills” the materials, rendering them silent to you.

#### One with Nature: Plants  
XP Cost: 3  
You are able to commune with and in a limited way communicate with plants. This may be through a spell you cast, a piece of technology you’ve created, or a spiritual bond with nature. Whatever the means, you can hear the thoughts of plants from the smallest weed to the largest tree.  
If they are getting adequate resources to grow, plants are generally pleasant conversationalists, often talking about weather patterns or similar topics. Trees will discuss the lives of the animals living within their branches, and grasses will talk about grazers coming for them and being stepped on.

#### Sixth Sense  
XP Cost: 5  
You have a innate ability to sense supernatural influences. This can be angelic, demonic, undead, fey, eldritch, or anything between. When you focus your senses, you can detect if a supernatural being is within thirty feet of you. You know the creature’s general location and what sort of creature it is. You can also sense when supernatural forces have tampered with otherwise natural processes in a residual way.

#### Speak with the Ancient Dead  
XP Cost: 5  
Prerequisite: [Speak with the Recently Dead](#speak-with-the-recently-dead)  
Your ability to speak with corpses improves; now all that is required is an intact skull. The state of the rest of the body does not matter.

#### Speak with the Recently Dead  
XP Cost: 5  
You can speak with corpses. The corpses know everything they knew in life, up until the last day of their lives, which they completely forget. Corpses in this state have no emotions, and cannot learn new information, including the fact that they are dead. They also cannot move. The corpse must still have enough lungs and vocal cords to be able speak, or this Utility fails. This could be harnessing necromancy, utilizing nanobots to reconstruct what the body's brain knew, being an effective medium, knowledge of certain rituals, or similar measures.

#### Speak with the Recently Dead, Improved  
XP Cost: 7  
Prerequisite: [Speak with the Recently Dead](#speak-with-the-recently-dead), [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) 2  
You can learn more from corpses; corpses you speak with in this way now remember everything the knew up to the moment of their death. If you also have (Speak with the Ancient Dead)[#speak-with-the-ancient-dead] this effect extends to them.

#### Slow Fall  
XP Cost: 4  
You are able to reduce the injuries you take when falling by half. This might represent gliding down with wings, casting a spell that cushions your descent, a device that reduces your falling speed, or just training to be better able to reduce the injuries that come from falling.

# Chapter 10: Combat
Combat is frequently part of an exciting story. While not every game needs combat, many stories eventually lead to a conflict that cannot be solved peacefully. This chapter presents rules for handling said conflicts.

## Surprise/Ambush
The Arbiter determines who might be surprised in a given scenario. It often involves Awareness checks against Stealth checks, but different situations may call for different rolls. If a creature is surprised, it doesn’t act in the first round of combat and is treated as [Flat Footed](#flat-footed).

## Time in Combat
Actions in combat are organized into Rounds and Turns. Each set of actions a character takes constitutes that character’s Turn. A set of everyone taking their Turn is called a Round and represents approximately 10 seconds in game. Each Round is broken down into three phases.

### Round Start
At the start of the Round, everyone pays the Upkeep of any Abilities that have one, reduce the counter on Abilities that have Cooldowns, as well as any Abilities or effect with limited duration.

### Initiative
Most combat takes place in the second phase, Initiative.  
Before combat can begin, everyone needs to know the turn order. This is determined by the Initiative roll. Everyone rolls normally, adding their Finesse, Soul, and any other modifiers. The person with the highest result goes first, followed by the next highest, and so on until everyone has had a Turn.  
If there’s a tie, the creature with the higher Initiative modifier goes first. If that’s still a tie, then the two creatures make an opposed tiebreaker roll.  
You may choose to delay your Turn if you like. When your Turn comes, you simply declare who you want your Turn to come after instead. On the next Round, your initiative order returns to where it originally was.

### Round End
At the end of the Round, you apply damage or healing from the [Regen/Degen Track](#the-regendegen-track). Some Abilities, Lessons, and Talents add additional steps to the Round end, unique to each character.

### Actions
When your Turn comes, you get two Actions to work with: one Major and one Minor. Anything that would affect the state of the fight will fall into one of those two categories, and Abilities list in their descriptions whether they are a Major or Minor Action. Things such as speaking or movements that don’t really change the state of the fight do not require an Action. You may forgo any combination of your Actions if you don’t want to take them on your Turn; you’re not required to use them.  
Between your Turns, you have one Counter Action. Some Abilities allow you to use this action to do something on another combatant's Turn. Abilities that requires a Counter Action will list a condition that must be fulfilled before the action can be used.

> When it’s not your Turn, you should be considering what your next action is going to be. Just because someone else is doing the talking doesn’t mean you should stop thinking. Actively planning your Turn during your friends’ actions means the game will be faster and more fun for everyone.

## Moving and Positioning
Knowing who you can reach and who can reach you is critical in combat, so these rules are here to help you keep up with the flow of a fight.  
Combat is broken up into Squares. A combat Square should generally be somewhere between 20-40 feet in length, square-ish in shape, and easy to understand on a quick drawing. It may represent a room or a hallway. A great hall in a large building may have several Squares. An open field would just be an effectively infinite number of Squares that characters can move through freely. Multiple creatures can occupy a single Square, and unless there is an Ability or circumstance saying otherwise everyone is able to get into melee range of everyone else in the same Square.  
Characters can (usually) move to any adjacent Squares by spending a minor action. This might represent running, jumping, climbing, swimming, or any other kind of motion to get around, in any combination. 

### Impact 
To make an Offense roll, first you roll your 2d10 as normal and add your modifier. If the Ability you are using to strike is labeled as an Attack, you use Physical Offense. Abilities labeled as Spells instead add your Mental Offense. Once you have this result, subtract your target’s Defense: Physical Defense for Attacks and Mental Defense for Spells. (There are exceptions which will be described in those abilities’ descriptions). The result is called the Impact, and if the Impact is above zero, your Ability has landed and will affect your opponent. By and large this will mean dealing damage, but some abilities instead impose conditions or something else unpleasant when they land. The amount of damage you deal is determined by multiplying your Impact by the Ability’s damage multiplier.

> Note that the term "Spell" is used as a term to differentiate from physical and mental strikes. An Ability listed as a Spell can function due to magic, technology, equipment, or similar sources.

## Chasing rules
Sometimes when two opposing factions meet, one is not willing to stand and fight. This can result in a chase scene, in which one party is trying to get away from a pursuing party. The individual or group being chased is called the Quarry, while the one(s) doing the chasing are the Hunter(s).

### Position During Chases
During a chase, exact position doesn’t necessarily matter as much as distance between the Quarry and the Hunter. There is no need to make a large map to have a chase. Instead, assign each participant in the chase a number, representing how far they are from the chase’s starting point. This number is called the character’s Position, and it determines what they can do to other participants in the chase. At the start of the chase, the Hunter that’s farthest from the Quarry should be assigned Position 0, with others in the chase being assigned Positions based on how far from this starting point they are. Any action or effect that would normally cause you to move a Square instead allows you to instead increase (or decrease) your Position by 1.

### Endurance
A chase is as much about endurance as it is about speed. You start every chase with an Endurance score equal to your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) + Toughness + Heart. You can spend Endurance to use one of the actions described below, or preserve it in order to continue a long-distance chase.  
At the [Round End](#round-end) during a chase, everyone involved that moved that Round must make an Endure check. This check starts at a target of 10, and on a success nothing happens other than the target increasing by 2 the next Round. On a failure, you lose one point of Endurance and the Endure check’s difficulty goes back to 10 for the next Round.  
If your Endurance score goes negative, you lose that much HP every time you move a Square of your own volition.

### Actions During Chases
There are a few things one can do that is specific to chase scenes to consider.

#### Use Abilities
All Abilities available to you outside of a chase scene are available during chases as well. In order to use a Melee range Ability, your Position must match your target’s. To use a Close range Ability, your Position must be within 1 of your target’s; for Medium, 2; for Long, 3. Abilities that did only damage previously still do so, but any Ability that affects movement can be used to get an upper hand during the chase.

#### Sprint
Sprinting is a Major Action, and allows you to move three Positions at once. Doing this costs a point of Endurance.

#### Recover
Recovery is a Major Action, and you cannot use your Minor Action to do anything that causes you to move. This recovers one point of Endurance, up to a maximum of your [Hero Tier](#hero-tier) + Toughness + Heart.

# Chapter 11: Health, Injury, Death, and Recovery
In the course of your group’s story, the players will face adversity. They will endure pain. Flesh fails, bones break, and blood flows. This is a part of adventuring, and all adventures make their own peace with this reality in time. This section of the rule book will describe the rules that govern this grim part of the hero’s journey.

## What are HP?
HP (hit points or health points, both work) are an abstract representation of a character’s health. While the character still has HP, they can still press on. At a glance this could just be how much punishment the character can endure, but one could take it farther than that. Endurance, pain tolerance, mental fortitude, and dumb luck can all be part of a character’s HP maximum.

### What does it mean to lose HP?
Losing HP does not necessarily mean being struck by a weapon or attack. Remember, HP are abstract. Losing HP can be represented by narrowly avoiding a brutal attack (and thus using up one’s luck). It could be parrying a heavy blow, but suffering significant pain in one’s arm from the effort (testing one’s pain tolerance). It could be expending internal energy to throw an arcane shield up to deflect a spell (draining one’s endurance). And, maybe in the end, it could be getting a knife in the back. One should take getting hit as an opportunity for creativity, just like dealing a hit.

## What types of damage are there?
Broadly speaking, there are eight types of damage. Some beings may be vulnerable to some types, resistant or even immune to others. Ideally a party has a variety of damage types to work with with and can adjust to the enemy’s makeup as you go. Players are unlikely to know what types of damages work well upon first encountering a creature. They can use Scan Abilities to determine their targets’ elemental properties or try experimenting. Some things are reasonable to guess; an ice monster probably doesn’t like fire and doesn’t mind ice for example.

The damage types are as follows:
* *Physical* - Slashing, piercing, bashing. This is by far the most common type of damage.
* *Fire* - Burning, scorching, heat. Fire damage is broadly the way to describe damage that comes from using high temperatures.
* *Ice* - Piercing with icicles, chilling winds, sucking the heat out of the air. If the damage source is primarily low temperatures, it is ice damage.
* *Sky* - Zapping with lightning, being struck by slashing winds, and similar things. If it’s about electricity or wind, the damage type is Sky.
* *Earth* - Earth damage can be from launched rocks, being struck by plant vines, or a dip in acid. This is one of the more eclectic damage types, but it encompasses everything themed around the earth, from stones to the plants that grow from it.
* *Light* - Blinding radiance, searing lasers, holy light. Any time light itself is weaponized, it is light damage.
* *Dark* - Consuming blackness, draining life, unholy blight. If the damage comes from utilizing darkness or draining away the health of others, it is dark damage.
* *Almighty* - Beyond definition and comprehension, power in its rawest form. Almighty damage is extremely rare, and no force in existence can resist it.

With the exception of Almighty damage, enemies may have resistances or weaknesses to any combination of these damage types. A character can tell when they have struck a resistance or weakness as their blow lands; the results should be dramatically different from their expectations and make it very clear what is happening.

## What are Injuries?
When you lose all HP, you take an injury and fall unconscious. You can’t move, take actions, and are completely unaware of your surroundings. Anything that would cause additional damage while you’re at zero HP causes an additional injury.  
Injuries in Story Shaper are the decidedly less abstract consequences of failing certain tasks or running out of HP. An injury reduces one of your Attributes by one until it is tended to.  
When you sustain an injury, you take that single six sided die that is listed in Story Shaper’s required components and roll. The type of injury inflicted is decided by the die result.
1. *Strength*. You’ve torn a muscle, broken a bone, lost so much blood that you can’t pack the same kind of punch as you used to, or something similar.
2. *Finesse*. You’ve torn a ligament, broken your fingers, sustained nerve damage that makes movement difficult or painful, or otherwise lost mobility. 
3. *Toughness*. You’ve broken a rib and/or punctured a lung, lost a lot of blood, or otherwise picked up some affliction that makes you less vigorous than your best.
4. *Mind*. You’ve suffered a concussion, have sight damage, are dealing with temporary memory loss, or some other problem that makes you duller than usual.
5. *Soul*. You’ve suffered pain that breaks through your resolve, have a ringing in your ears, are generally questioning yourself, or something that interrupts your inner tranquility. 
6. *Heart*. You’ve suffered a concussion, severe pain, perhaps perceive a betrayal (real or imagined) that makes you less sociable for the time being.

As always, these methods of describing an injury are just suggestions. Players and Arbiters are free to come up with their own.

### How can I get Injured?
There are many dangers in an adventure that can result in an injury. The most obvious is hitting zero HP in combat, but this isn’t the only way. Here is a quick list of other ways to be injured. (Note that not all injury types are suitable in all circumstances. The Arbiter makes this choice and adjusts injury rolls appropriately. For example, if the dice roll a Heart injury from falling, the Arbiter may choose to reroll until something appropriate comes up.)
* Falling. Falling from a great height will typically result in injuries. For every 30 feet one falls, one will sustain an additional injury. Characters can make an Acrobatics check to try and reduce the damage from falling, reducing the height fallen by half the check’s result. Characters with [Flight](#flight) generally don’t need to worry about falling damage. Falling can cause Strength, Finesse, or Toughness injuries.
* Poison/Venom. The various creatures of the world may secrete harmful substances as they attack you. These will be listed in each creature’s information. A bite from a giant spider may cause a Finesse injury, while breathing in the spores of a territorial fungus might cause a Mind injury. These injuries can often be resisted with Endure checks.
* Traps. Slides into a spiked floor, arrows launched when a pressure plate is depressed, a bladed pendulum set to swing by a trip wire--these sorts of devious perils may cause HP damage, but they may instead leave lingering injuries, at the Arbiter's preference. They can typically be avoided with Awareness, Athletics, and/or Acrobatics checks. They can be disabled entirely with Sabotage checks.
* Fatigue. Circumstance forces a character to march throughout the night, forgoing food, water, and rest, through driving rain and cold and without shelter. This will wear on the character, and compounding fatigue is represented with injuries.
   * When going without sleep for a night, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take a random injury. On a success, you soldier on, but the next night you have to go without sleep you repeat the check with +5 difficulty. This continues stacking until you sleep for at least six hours. Failing this check does not reset the difficulty; only sleep can do that.
   * After two weeks without food, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take an injury to Strength, Endurance, or Dexterity. On a success, you can do without for a little longer. Every day spent without eating from here on requires another Endure check with +1 difficulty. This stacks until you get a good meal. Failing a check does not reset the difficulty.
   * After three days without water, make an Endure check, difficulty 10. On a failure, you take a random injury. On a success, you can do without for a little longer. Every day spent without water from here on requires another Endure check with +4 difficulty. This stacks until you get a drink, and failure does not reset the difficulty.
   * Every day spent without shelter from severe rain, cold, or heat requires an Endure check, difficulty determined by the Arbiter based on the conditions. Failure results in an injury appropriate to the situation.

These are just a few examples, and the Arbiter can likely come up with more in their games.

## How can I Recover?
There are several ways to approach recovery of HP, MP, and injuries. Here are some recommended options (beyond healing Abilities, of course).

* *Rapid, heroic pulp*.  The heroes bounce back from activity quickly, showing boundless energy. In this case, heroes regain all HP/MP after resting for 5 minutes. Recovering from an injury requires resting for an hour, which heals one injury of the player’s choice. 
   * This recovery method emphasizes action, enables risk taking, and encourages blowing everything quickly. This will result in faster battles since everyone is going full tilt at all times. Whatever happens will happen fast. 
* *Middle ground*. The heroes typically need a break after a dangerous encounter, and a long day of peril will wear them down. In this mode, resting for an hour regenerates HP equal to your Toughness + Character [Level](#level) and MP equal to your Heart + Character level (minimum 1 HP/MP per hour). Resting for eight hours straight regenerates all HP and MP and heals one injury. If the character is tended to by someone during this time, the tender may attempt a Medicine check, difficulty 10 + the number of injuries the target has received. On a success, the target heals one additional injury during their rest. 
   * This recovery system is a compromise, encouraging players not to blow everything immediately, but still potentially rewards explosive action and risk taking when appropriate.
* *Survival*. Damage lingers. Injuries will pile up. MP are precious. In this dangerous format, resting for eight hours regenerates HP equal to your Toughness + Character [Level](#level) and MP equal to your Heart + Character level. Healing from an injury requires two full days of bed rest. If the character is tended to by someone during this time, the tender may attempt a Medicine check, difficulty 10 + the number of injuries the target has received. On a success, you heal an injury every day instead of every two days. 
   * In this format, you must track resources carefully and spend them dearly. Players are likely encouraged to avoid combat when possible and play extremely frugally when it does happen.
* *Action Movie* - Low HP, High Injury, Instant Recovery. In this format, all characters’ maximum HP are halved. When they hit zero HP they still receive an injury as normal, but instead of going unconscious they instead regain their maximum HP. Use the same injury rules as either Heroic Pulp or Middle Ground recovery, Arbiter's choice.
   * This mode has a specific purpose: to capture the action movie brawl. Two opponents square off, striking at each other for a period until eventually one gets an advantage and lands a powerful series of blows on the other. There’s a painful sound as the scene slows down, showing the loser of the exchange reeling in pain while the victor gets a moment to gloat. The loser then refocuses and continues the fight, but a bit shakier, until one or the other cannot stand any longer.

These are recommendations that should provide a good variety, suitable to most types of games.

## How does Death Work?
There is a point past which a character’s body can no longer endure injury, and they perish. For the enemies, this threshold should be quite low. Expendable sorts who play no major role in the story should likely just die immediately when their HP are spent. Plot-centric characters may have a higher threshold, three to five. The death of a player character has much larger implications on the game and should be considered more carefully. My recommendation is to declare a character with ten injuries dead.  

### Is Resurrection a Thing?
That is up to the Arbiter and should suit the setting. Allowing resurrection invites some serious questions. How common is it? What does it require? What stops antagonists from being resurrected after the heroes are done with them? The handbook is not going to set down hard rules for resurrecting dead player characters, because it should be custom to each setting. It’s worth noting that players are NOT necessarily entitled to this information. It’s up to the Arbiter.

## Status Ailments
These effects are lingering problems that hamper a characters' ability to function. These effects can be removed by Abilities and effects such as [Remedy](#remedy).

#### Blind  
You cannot see. If you attempt to strike a target that you can hear or whose location you know without need for sight, you only roll a single ten sided die for the attack. You cannot effectively defend yourself while blinded as well, so attacks against you gain Boon +6.

#### Chill X  
Partially frozen or dealing with a lingering cold. This reduces your Physical Defense by X for its duration.

#### Crush X
Crushed by stones, blinded by sand, restrained by vines, or other similar means of hindering foes with the earth. This reduces your Physical Offense by X for its duration.

#### Drained  
Afflicted by a life draining curse, necromantic energies, or similar hindrances. This reduces all life recovery you would receive by half for its duration.

#### Provoked
An opponent has demanded your attention. Any actions you take that affect opponents must include the creature that Provoked you, including any area of effect or curse effects.  
Provoke overrides [Taunt](#taunt); any enemies you Provoke will strike you regardless of being in a Square with an ally with Taunt.  
This may represent an opponent shouting insults to grab attention, minor mind control, jamming targeting systems, or other similar ways to demand attention in combat.

#### Rooted
For some reason, you cannot move. This might mean being tied down, having an injured foot, entangled in grasping vines, or similar things that stop you from moving. Being rooted does not otherwise affect your combat ability, you just cannot move from your current space.

#### Scorch X  
On fire or dealing with a lingering burn. This reduces your Mental Defense by X for its duration.

#### Shock X
Shocked, rattled by sonic damage, or the like. This reduces your Mental Offense by X for its duration.

#### Slowed
You are hobbled in a way that makes you slower, though you can still move somewhat. While slowed, you cannot use your Minor Action to move to a different Square.

#### Stagger  
Knocked silly. While Staggered, you lose your Minor action and have Bane -1. Unless a different duration is listed, Staggers only last one Round (or 10 seconds outside of Initiative).

## Disadvantages
These are circumstances in combat that leave one in a disadvantage during combat. These generally cannot be dismissed through magical means.

#### Distracted
Unable to bring fully react to your situation. Distracted characters cannot use their Counter action. Unless otherwise noted, Distraction lasts until the character in question takes an action.

#### Flat Footed
You are not prepared to defend yourself from attacks properly. Attacks against you are made at Boon +4. Flat Footed characters are also [Distracted](#distracted). Unless otherwise noted, you cease being Flat Footed upon taking an action or being successfully struck by a damaging Ability.

#### Prone  
Lying on the ground. Melee range Abilities against Prone targets have Boon +3, while any Abilities coming from beyond Short range are made at Bane -3. Moving a Square while Prone costs a major action.  
You may fall Prone or stand up as a minor action. 

## Advantages
These are circumstances that give the character in question an advantage.

#### Flight  
You can fly. This allows you to move into the airborne parts of the battle grid. Airborne movement is otherwise identical to standard movement.
This Condition makes you immune to terrain effects.

#### Obscured  
You are invisible or otherwise very difficult to see, which makes you extremely difficult to hit or track. Any foe that is able to target you with a single target attack makes said attack with only a single ten sided die. (Obscured provides no benefit against area of effect attacks.)

#### Protection
A Protected character cannot be targeted by offensive Abilities and is excluded from any offensive area of effect.

#### Shield X
You have a barrier or defense active that takes damage for you. While you have any amount of Shield, damage done to you subtracts from your Shield amount before your HP. You cannot use Shield to pay HP costs, and effects described as "losing" life or HP (such as HP loss from low Endurance during a chase) still subtract directly from your HP. Shield gained from different sources stacks.

#### Taunt
If you have Taunt and are in a space with any other ally, enemies must target you. Any Abilities that pick a target can only pick you. Abilities that affect Squares instead of targets can still affect your allies as normal.
